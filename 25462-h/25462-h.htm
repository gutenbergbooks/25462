<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Let</span> <i>me</i> do it. Let <i>me</i> make it," is the cry when a child
sees an older person putting together the different parts of
an interesting piece of work; and it is this desire to do
things himself, this impulse toward self-expression, that,
when properly directed, forms so great a factor in his all-around
development and education. Using the hands and
brain together stimulates interest and quickens observation
and intelligence, and, as the object takes form beneath the
little fingers, the act of making, of creating, brings with it a
delight and satisfaction which the mere possession of the
same thing made by another can not give. "Look! See
what <i>I</i> have made," comes with a ring of triumph as the
childish hands gleefully hold up the finished article for
inspection.</p>

<p>In this book we have endeavored to open a new and
large field of simple handicrafts for little folk, giving them
an original line of toys and a new line of materials with
which to make them. We hope in these pages to bring to
children the joy of making creditable and instructive toys
of such ordinary things as empty spools, sticks of kindling
wood, wooden clothespins, natural twigs, old envelopes and
newspapers, and in this way to encourage resourcefulness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
originality, inventiveness, and the power to do with supplies
at hand.</p>

<p>Everything described in the book has been actually made
by the authors, and made by such practical and simple
methods that a child's mind can grasp them, and a child's
hands be easily trained to manufacture the articles. It is,
therefore, our hope that the "Little Folks' Handy Book"
will be found useful both in Kindergarten and Primary
grades of the schools and in the home nursery; a helpful
friend to teachers and to mothers.</p>

<h2>LITTLE FOLKS' HANDY BOOK</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>PAPER BUILDING CARDS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Make</span> your building cards of ordinary writing-paper.
You may have as many cards as you like, though twelve are
all that are used to make the things shown in our photographs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i009a.png" width="300" height="169" alt="Fig. 1&mdash;Cut an oblong out like this." title="Fig. 1&mdash;Cut an oblong out like this." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 1&mdash;Cut an oblong out like this.</span>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;"><a name="Fig_2" id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/i009b.png" width="200" height="156" alt="Fig. 2&mdash;This is the building card." title="Fig. 2&mdash;This is the building card." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 2&mdash;This is the building card.</span>
</div>

<p>For each card cut an oblong of paper five inches long and
two and a half inches wide. This is a very good size, but you
can make them a little larger or smaller. Always remember,
however, to have them just twice as long as they are wide, and
all of one size. When you have cut out the oblong (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>)
fold it through the middle, bringing the two short edges evenly
together. The dotted line in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a> shows where it is to be
folded. Now open the oblong half-way and you will have
the building card (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). They are very simple and easy
to make, aren't they? But wonderful and delightful things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
can be built with these pieces of paper. You can have a
whole camp of little tents by standing the cards with the
folded edge up; and to make</p>


<h3>A Camp Chair</h3>

<div class='unindent'>all you need do is to push two of your tents close together,
then on top of their folded edges lay another card with one
flat side down to form the seat and the other side up for the
back.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;"><a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i010a.jpg" width="272" height="300" alt="Fig. 3&mdash;You can make a little camp chair." title="Fig. 3&mdash;You can make a little camp chair." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 3&mdash;You can make a little camp chair.</span>
</div>

<p>The second illustration (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) shows just how to do this.
Use the tents again for</p>


<h3>The Pyramid</h3>

<div class='unindent'>in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. Stand three tents in a row close together. On top
of these make a floor by laying two cards across with one side
of each card extending down at the back of the tents. Then
build a second story&mdash;two tents this time, with a floor on top.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;"><a name="Fig_4" id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i010b.jpg" width="265" height="300" alt="Fig. 4&mdash;Use the tents to make this pyramid." title="Fig. 4&mdash;Use the tents to make this pyramid." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 4&mdash;Use the tents to make this pyramid.</span>
</div>

<p>The third and top story will be one tent, which forms the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
peak of the pyramid. Of course you can make your pyramid
very much larger by adding more tents to the first row and
then building it up higher.</p>


<h3>The Stable</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is very cunning with its four little stalls. To build it you
must stand the cards on their side edges as in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>. One
side forms the back wall of the stall, the other the side wall.
When you have reached the end of the row you will find the
last stall lacks a side wall, but all you have to do is to slide
another back wall behind the last and there you have the
needed side wall. Put a roof over the stalls just as you made
the floors for your pyramid, and then stand a tent on top for
the cupola. Place a card at each end of the stalls, as shown
in the illustration, and your stable is ready for its tiny horses.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;"><a name="Fig_5" id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="467" height="250" alt="Fig. 5&mdash;A little stable with four little stalls." title="Fig. 5&mdash;A little stable with four little stalls." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 5&mdash;A little stable with four little stalls.</span>
</div>

<p>Build</p>


<h3>The Garden Wall</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) by standing the cards on their side edges. You can
make the garden any size or shape you like, but always have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the gateway just wide enough to hold the tent roof on top.
See how the cards stand with edges in on either side of the
opening. This will support the tent-shaped roof. Perhaps
the children will want a house in the garden. You can build
one if you try. Then see how many more things can be
made of the paper cards, for I have not told you half of them.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>TOYS MADE OF COMMON WOODEN BERRY-BASKETS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Use</span> a one-quart wooden berry-box for the china closet
(<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>). Turn the empty box facing you, and slide the
prongs of a clothespin up through the open crack at the
lower right hand of the box. Allow one prong of the clothespin
to come on the outside and the other prong on the inside
of the thin wooden side of the box; adjust the clothespin well
to the front edge of the box, and it will form the right-hand
front leg of the china closet. Add another leg in like manner
on the same side of the box for the back leg; then slide two
more clothespins up on the opposite side of the box to form
the remaining two legs (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 8&mdash;Slide clothespins on the basket for legs.</span>
</div>
</td></tr>
</table></div>




<p>The prongs of the clothespins do not reach up to the top
of the inside of the box, but leave sufficient space for a shelf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Make the shelf by laying a clothespin across from side to
side, supported by the prongs of the back legs, and another
across, supported by the prongs of the front legs (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>).
The clothespin used for the front of the shelf will probably
have to be a trifle longer than that for the back, as the box
is wider in front than at the back. Set some toy dishes on
the top, the shelf, and the inside bottom of the china closet,
as in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>With another quart berry-box and four more clothespins
make the</p>


<h3>Doll's Table</h3>

<p>Slide the prongs of a clothespin down on either side of the
box at the four corners (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>), then turn the table right side
up, placing it on its feet. Set the table with toy dishes, and
dinner will be ready (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The table can be turned into a dressing-case by standing
two clothespins on their heads at each side of the back of the
top of the table, and sliding a piece of stiff paper across from
clothespin to clothespin between the prongs for a mirror<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). Of course, the addition of a fringed white paper,
or cloth scarf, over the top of the dressing-case would enhance
its appearance, as would also a table-cloth over the top of
the dinner table, but the covers were purposely omitted in
the photographs that one may see exactly how the articles
were made.</p>

<h3>Dolly's Bassinet</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>) of a small oblong berry-basket with four clothespin
legs slanting outward at the bottom and the prongs of the legs
on each side brought together at the top (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>). On the
centre of one end of the basket slide down the prongs of a
fifth clothespin to form the upright for holding drapery (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>). When adjusted, fold a lady's handkerchief diagonally
through the centre and hang it over the support, as in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>.
The bassinet will then be ready for a folded handkerchief as
bedding and a little baby doll.</div>

<p>A comical little berry-basket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>"Bow-wow"</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>) can be made by using a two-quart basket for the
body, the bassinet basket for a head, and clothespins for
ears, tail, and legs. Fasten the legs on the body so that the
front legs will slant forward and the back legs backward, that
the dog may appear to be running (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>); slide a clothespin
on the end of the basket for a tail; then fasten two
clothespins slanting backward on the small basket for ears;
set the small basket on the front end of the large one, placing
it so that almost half of it projects over the large basket, and
the comical little dog will be finished.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>STRAW AND PAPER FURNITURE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A handful</span> of straws, such as are used for lemonade and
soda-water, several large sheets of writing-paper, and some
small-sized pins&mdash;these are your materials. A pair of sharp
scissors, a ruler marked off into whole, half, and quarter
inches, and a lead pencil&mdash;these are your tools.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;"><a name="Fig_17" id="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="419" height="400" alt="Fig. 17&mdash;The old-fashioned bedstead." title="Fig. 17&mdash;The old-fashioned bedstead." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 17&mdash;The old-fashioned bedstead.</span>
</div>

<p>We will begin with the old-fashioned four-post bedstead
with its canopy and valances (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). It is easily put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
together, but you must be careful to cut the straws for the
posts all exactly the same length, making them about seven
inches long, and to have your measurements for the other
parts quite correct, in order that the bedstead may stand
perfectly upright. Select four straight straws for the posts&mdash;sound
and whole. Split straws will not do.</p>

<p>The mattress and canopy are exactly alike; each has its
valance, and they are just the same size; so directions for one
will answer for both. Cut an oblong of writing-paper eight
and a half inches long and six and a half inches wide. Be
sure that the ends and side edges form perfect right angles;
if they do not, the bed will be crooked. The edges of your
sheet of writing-paper are at right angles to one another, and
if you use the top edge of your paper for the top edge of your
oblong, and the side edge of the paper for one side edge of
your oblong, the rest will come out all right.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;"><a name="Fig_18" id="Fig_18"></a>
<img src="images/i018.png" width="391" height="300" alt="Fig. 18&mdash;The mattress and canopy." title="Fig. 18&mdash;The mattress and canopy." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 18&mdash;The mattress and canopy.</span>
</div>

<p>Now draw perfectly straight lines across your oblong from
top to bottom, just one and a half inches from each edge
(<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). Then from
side to side draw two
more straight lines; the
first one and a half inches
below the top edge and
the other one and a half
inches above the bottom
edge. This gives the
mattress with a border
all around. In each corner
of the mattress, a little
more than a quarter
of an inch from the end and side lines, draw a small cross as
shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. Be sure these crosses are placed correctly,
and are exactly alike in mattress and canopy. Now cut out
the four squares at the corners of the oblong, as indicated by
the heavy lines in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>, and insert the point of your scissors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in the centre of each little cross and snip along each line of
the cross. Do not make the slashes too deep.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 198px;"><a name="Fig_19" id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i019.png" width="198" height="300" alt="Fig. 19&mdash;Slide the paper down to the pin." title="Fig. 19&mdash;Slide the paper down to the pin." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 19&mdash;Slide the paper down to the pin.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut the edges of the border, or valance, into small points,
as in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>; then bend the valance down at the sides and
ends of the mattress. The dotted
lines in the diagrams show where to
bend the paper. Make the canopy
just as you have made the mattress,
but cut deeper points on the edge of
the valance.</p>

<p>Through each of the four straw
bedposts run a small pin two and a
quarter inches from the end of the
straw (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).</p>



<p>Push the long ends of the straws
up through the slashed crosses in the
corners of the mattress (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>) until
the bottom of the mattress rests on
the pins, then run a pin through each
straw just above and close to the top of the mattress. Between
the two pins the paper can slip neither up nor down.
Run another pin in each straw post half an inch from the
top, slide the canopy down upon these, and fasten with more
pins, as you did the mattress. Make the bolster by folding
a piece of paper the proper shape and cutting the end edges
in points for trimming.</p>

<p>Now you not only know how to make the bedstead, but</p>


<h3>The Little Table</h3>

<div class='unindent'>as well, for if you will look at <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> you will see that it is
put together in the same manner as the bedstead.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;"><a name="Fig_20" id="Fig_20"></a>
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="364" height="400" alt="Fig. 20&mdash;The little table." title="Fig. 20&mdash;The little table." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 20&mdash;The little table.</span>
</div>

<p>Make the legs of the table three inches long. Cut the top
of the table four inches long and three and a half inches
wide, and the shelf three and a half inches long and three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
inches wide. Measure one-quarter of an inch from each
edge of the table top and draw straight lines as in <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>.
This will give you a narrow border all around the top.</p>

<p>Make and cut the little crosses in the corners of top and
shelf, then cut out the squares at the corners of the top and
bend down the edges. The shelf of the table should be one
inch above the bottom ends of the straws, and the top of the
table one-quarter of an inch below the top ends of the
straws.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;"><a name="Fig_21" id="Fig_21"></a>
<img src="images/i021.png" width="371" height="300" alt="Fig. 21&mdash;A narrow border all around the
table top." title="Fig. 21&mdash;A narrow border all around the
table top." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 21&mdash;A narrow border all around the
table top.</span>
</div>

<p>By making the straw legs of the table twice as long, and
the top and shelves narrower, you can have another useful
article of furniture, for by adding two shelves of paper on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the straws, and fastening them in the same way, this can be
used as a cupboard or shelves on which to place the tiny
doll dishes or clothes. The table can also be made into a
little dressing-table, by simply
using for the back legs
straws twice as long as the
front legs and then slipping
a square piece of paper on
the straws that extend above
the table, to serve as a mirror.
Just as the paper is
slipped on the straws for the
back of the chair (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>),
silver paper is pasted on this
to make it look like glass.</p>

<p>With these few patterns you can make any number of
useful articles to furnish Miss Dolly's house. You can make
small beds and large beds, small tables and large tables, and
many sizes of chairs.</p>

<p>You can make</p>


<h3>The Chair</h3>

<div class='unindent'>by merely looking at <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a> and the diagrams, <a href="#Fig_23">Figs. 23</a> and
<a href="#Fig_24">24</a>. No pins were used in this, but if you want the chair to
last it is best to fasten it securely like the rest of the furniture.
The straws for the back should be six inches long and for the
front legs two and a quarter inches long. The shelf under
the chair is the size of the seat.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 209px;"><a name="Fig_22" id="Fig_22"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 22&mdash;The high-backed chair.</span>
</div>

<p>This furniture will be especially useful in playing with
paper dolls, and by using different colors, in colored papers,
you can have a blue room, a pink room, and a green
room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 188px;"><a name="Fig_23" id="Fig_23"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 23&mdash;Push the straw through the back of the chair.</span>
</div>

<p>You can make tissue-paper sheets and spread for the bed
and pillow-slips, too, if you like. Thus dolly can be tucked
away snugly for the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingenuity exercised in the construction of these simple
articles will encourage the development of deftness and skill
in the little fingers, which are ever ready to imitate anything
that teacher can make.</p>

<p>Cut your square of paper even and straight. Place it out flat
on top of a bare table and fold at the centre along the dotted
line (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>), which will make <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>. Bend each side of this
down outwardly along its centre at the dotted line and bring

then your paper will be four layers like <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>. Turn up the

loose edge on the bottom under the other loose edge; then
pinch each bottom point and bend it down toward the centre
of the boat, creasing it flat (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>). Turn the boat right side
up again, set it on the table, bend the two sides well up and
crease them along the bottom until the boat resembles <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p>To render the craft water-proof melt a piece of wax candle,
turn the boat upside down again and give the bottom a coat
of the melted white wax, extending the coat half way or more
up the sides. Use a teaspoon for pouring the wax over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
boat; the hot wax soon hardens and in a few moments you
may launch the little craft on the water.</p>

<h3>Sailing Vessel</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of your boat, roll up a one-inch-wide strip of newspaper into
an old-fashioned paper lighter, which is merely rolling the
strip spirally into a round stick; this is the mast. Cut a
paper sail, not too large, puncture holes in it and slide the
sail on the mast; add a small paper pennant on the extreme
top; then insert the base of the mast into a common wooden
spool and glue the spool tight to the bottom of the boat at the
centre of the bow.</div>

<p>With thread and needle take a stitch or two in the lower
corner of the sail and attach it with a short length of the
thread to the stern; fasten securely. Also fasten the pennant
to the mast, so that it cannot turn, for in this vessel both sail
and pennant must be stationary and not swing to either side.
Be careful not to have the sail too heavy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>PAPER JEWELRY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ordinary</span> brown wrapping paper is the best to use for
this paper jewelry. Indeed the pale, creamy yellow of some
wrapping paper is much like ivory in color, and the chains
and ornaments made of it are really charming.</p>


<h3>The Necklace</h3>

<p>See how simply the necklace is made without glue or paste.
It is a system of double rings that shift and slide in one's
hands like the links of a metal chain. When the principle
is understood it is all very easy.</p>

<p>The rings may be cut out free-hand by folding the paper as
in <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. Cut an oblong about six inches long and three
inches wide and fold it crosswise through the middle, then
bring the two side edges together and fold it again lengthwise.
Start at the top where the paper is folded and cut out the
ring as in <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. You will notice in the drawing that the
circle at the top is slightly elongated; this is necessary in
fitting the rings together. The ring when opened will look
like <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. Cut out six rings the size and shape of <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>,
then make two smaller ones, like A (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>), and eight still
smaller ones, like B (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>). Now cut a single ring perfectly
round, a trifle larger than <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>, a double ring like C
(<a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>), and a pearl-shaped pendant like <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. Open
<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a> and cut the three-cornered catch in one half and the
slit in the other half, as shown in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>. Cut the catch
first, then fold the pendant again, as in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>, and punch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
small holes with a pin at the base of the catch through the
other half, to mark the place for the slit. The slit must not
be as long as the base of the catch, else the catch will not hold.</p>

<span class="caption">The little queen. Adorned with paper jewelry.</span>
</div>

<p>Put the necklace together by slipping the half of one ring
over both halves of another, as in <a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>. Commence with
the single ring. Slip half of a large double ring through the
single ring, bring the double ring together and slip another
large ring through that, then add another large ring and you
will have a chain of three large rings with the single ring at
the end.</p>

just half of the necklace, for the single ring is to be the middle
one. Make the other half in the same way, starting on the
opposite side of the single ring and slipping ring into ring as
you did before. Attach the ring pendant, C (<a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>), to the
single ring between the two side rings, then add the pendant.
Fasten the two halves of the pendant together by folding the
two points of the catch inward, slipping the catch through
the slit and then spreading the points out again flat. This
makes a very secure fastening and, unless the neck of the
catch is too slender, it will neither break nor pull apart.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a> is the clasp for the necklace. Cut it out like the
pattern and make it about three inches long. Slip one end
of the clasp through the last ring on one end of the necklace,
the other end of the clasp through the last ring on the
other end of the necklace, then bring the clasp together
and slip the catch through the slit, as in <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>. The

finished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Coronet</h3>

<p>The coronet shown in the illustration of the "Little queen"
is cut in one piece (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>). At the widest part, from top to
bottom, it is three inches wide, and the ends may be lengthened
or shortened to fit any head. The ends must meet and
fasten at the back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;"><a name="Fig_44" id="Fig_44"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 45&mdash;Little rings ornament the coronet.</span>
</div>

<p>Little rings, one inch in diameter, cut like <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>, ornament
the coronet, as shown in <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. They are fastened by the
catch at the top through slits cut in the coronet. Make
three slits, one below the other, a little over one inch apart,
down the middle of the coronet, and on either side of these
make six more slits in the position shown on the right half
of <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. This gives fifteen slits, for which you must have
fifteen rings. These dangling little rings that shake and
twinkle with every movement are fascinating little ornaments,
and are far prettier than more elaborate designs.</p>


<h3>Ear-rings</h3>

<p>Quite oriental-looking ear-rings are made like <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. Cut
first two single elongated hoops like <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>, making them
almost three inches long and one and three-quarter inches
from side to side. These long hoops are to slip over the ears
to hold the ear-rings on. Cut two hoops, like D (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>), and
two pendants, like E (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>). Fasten the hoop D upon the
hoop (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>), and the pendant E upon the hoop D, clasping
the pendant by its catch as you did the pendant of the necklace.
The children need not follow exactly the shapes of the
"danglers" and pendants shown here&mdash;let them exercise
their own taste in these.</p>

<h3>A Link Bracelet</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a> is a link bracelet. Make this by folding a strip of
paper eight inches long crosswise through the middle. Bring
the folded end half way down and fold, turn back the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
end and fold like a fan. This divides the paper into six
equal parts. Now cut out the outer edge of all the links at
once. Free the two end links and cut out the centres of the
others, then cut the centres of the two links, as shown in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>, making the catch and slit like the pattern.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;"><a name="Fig_51" id="Fig_51"></a>

<p>The links of the long chain shown in the photograph of
"The queen and her captive," are cut exactly like the
bangle bracelet (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>). The slits and charms are, of
course, omitted. <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a> shows how the chain is put together
by slipping one link through another and fastening it with its
catch. You can make the chain any length. It is so strong
that only rough handling will pull it apart.</p>


<h3>The Lorgnette</h3>

<p>Now comes the lorgnette, which works beautifully made
of rather stiff paper. Make the case of a strip of paper three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
inches wide and eight inches long. Fold the paper lengthwise
through the middle and cut it, rounding at the top like
<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>. In one side cut a small round hole at the top, rather
near the edge of the case, F (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>), and fold back the lower
corners according to the dotted lines. Cut out the eyeglasses
like <a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>. Curl the edges of the ball G together and slide
the ball through the hole F in the case, as in <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.</p>

<p>The glasses swing quite loosely by this hinge, and will
slide easily in and out of the case. When tucked away
inside the case a little flirt of the hand, a turn of the wrist,
will throw them out and they can be lifted to a piquant little
nose in the most approved and fine-ladylike fashion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>WHAT TO MAKE OF EMPTY SPOOLS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Gather</span> up all the spools you can find, big, little, thick,
and thin; no matter how many, you can use them all. There
is no end of fun to be had with these always-on-hand, easily
found toys; they may be made into almost everything.</p>


<h3>Spool Houses</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are very simply constructed. Begin building by standing
ten spools in a straight row for the front of the house. Make
one side with seven spools placed at right angles with the
front. This gives you one corner of the house. Build the
back parallel to the front by standing nine spools at right
angles with the side. You will then have two corners of
the house and three sides. Add a row of six spools along
the empty space between the front and back of the house for
the fourth side, as in <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>. Remove the third and fourth
spools from the left-hand corner of the front of the house to
form the doorway, and examine the foundation&mdash;see that it
is even and straight before erecting the walls; then continue
the building, placing a spool on top of each foundation spool
(<a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>). Build on another layer of spools, except over the
second and third spools at the right hand of the doorway
opening (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>). Add another row of spools (<a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>), and
another (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>). Lay a piece of pasteboard box over the
top of the walls (<a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>), and make the roof of a piece of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>almost any kind of paper by bending and creasing the paper
down along the lengthwise centre and up along the lengthwise
edges. Place the roof on top of the pasteboard ceiling
(<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>). Do not have the roof project over the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
house where you are to build the chimney, for the chimney
must be quite close to the house. Select large spools for the
chimney and build it by standing one spool on top of another
until the chimney extends above the roof. You can top the
chimney by laying a piece of cardboard over the last spool
and placing two small spools on it side by side. Enclose the
yard with a spool fence; standing the spools a short distance
from each other, as in the photograph. Use spools of larger
size for the gateway, topping them with two smaller ones
(<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>).</div>

<h3>Sunshiny Garden</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>), with flowers and trees of paper and tubs and flower-pots
of spools, where the clothespin people may go for
recreation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></div>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 64&mdash;This is the way to make a tree.</span>
</div>
<p>The trees are easy to make and are very effective; they are
simply fringed strips of paper rolled like a paper lighter with
the large ends stuck into spools. Cut a strip of green tissue-paper
fifteen inches long and five wide; then cut one-third of
the strip narrow, about one inch wide, and fringe
the remaining two thirds (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>). With the
thumb and first finger of your right hand begin
to roll the corner as shown at A (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>). Continue
rolling, and the fringe, which forms the
foliage, will stand out on the outside of the rolled
part or trunk of the tree. When you reach the
solid, narrow part of the paper strip it will roll
into a smooth, round stick, forming the lower
part of the tree trunk. Paste the last wrapped
corner of the paper roll in place and clip the tree
trunk off even across the bottom edge; then
press it into a hole in the centre of an empty spool
of ordinary size, and there's your tree! You can
vary the foliage by crimping the fringe with knife
or scissors before the strip is rolled into a tree and
by having the fringe of some much longer than
that of others. If you use different tones, tints,
and shades of green, running from very light
to dark, and make a lot of them varying in
height, the trees will look very pretty and they can form a
jungle where toy wild animals can live; or a number of the
trees might form a playground or a grove where dolls may
go for a picnic.</p>



<p>In the photograph of the group of trees you will see a
number of pots of flowers. The flowers are disks and squares
of different bright-colored tissue-paper, each one with its
centre pinched together and twisted into a stemlike piece,
which is pushed down into a buttonhole-twist spool. Around
some of the flowers a smaller square of green may be used for
foliage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>You could make an extensive flower garden by using a
great number of these short, flat spools and bits of gay tissue-paper,
and they can be arranged and rearranged in many
different ways.</p>

<p>It is possible to make all kinds of toy furniture of spools.
If you want</p>


<h3>A Bedroom Set,</h3>

<div class='unindent'>use four spools for the legs of a bedstead, place them in
position and lay a piece of stiff white paper, bent up at one
end, on top of the spools. The bed will then be ready for
the doll (<a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>).</div>

</table></div>
<p>A little table can be made in a moment's time. All that
is necessary is to choose a large spool and place a round piece
of paper on the top (<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>). Make the bureau of six
spools close together in two rows of three spools each, and
cut the top of a piece of paper with a high extension in the
centre, which you must bend upright for a mirror. The
washstand can be four spools quite close together covered
with a piece of paper. A piano is easily made, but you must
think it out for yourself. Use a small spool for the piano-stool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Lamp</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>) is a spool with a little roll of white paper shoved
into the hole and a circular piece of paper crimped around
the edge for the shade. Unless you need the spool to use
again in other ways, you might paste the paper on and make
a lamp which will not come apart.</div>

<p>You can glue the tops on the table and washstand and the
mirror on the bureau also; though this is not necessary, for
if you are careful and do not knock against the furniture it
will remain secure.</p>

<p>Now make the toy</p>

<p>See how firm and substantial the little kitchen furniture
looks in the photograph with its fine stove, dresser, and wash-tub
(<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). Use four
spools for the feet of the
stove. Over these lay a
piece of pasteboard about
six inches long and four
inches wide, allowing it
to project beyond the
front feet to form the
apron; then build on the
body of the stove, making
it of spools two layers
deep, as in <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>.
Cut a piece of pasteboard
to fit over the spools for
the stove top, and have it
long enough to stand out
a short distance at the
back; then you can build on the stovepipe (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>).</p>

<p>For the tubs stand four spools close together, and set a little
round box on top of them. Make the washboard of a
piece of paper folded many times backward and forward,
fan fashion. After carefully creasing the folds, pull the
paper out slightly and put it in the tub for the next washday
(<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>).</p>

<h3>A Dining Table</h3>

<div class='unindent'>will be needed. With eight spools and a piece of pasteboard
cut from a box you can make a fine dining table; the
legs of the table are four columns of two spools each, as you
see in <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, and the chairs are made of spools with bent
pieces of cardboard pasted on top. The decorations of the
table are small spools with bright tissue-paper for flowers
arranged at the four corners of the table, and the plates are
the round pasteboard tops from milk bottles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></div>

<p>Cut <a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73</a> from heavy paper or cardboard that will fold
without breaking. Bend all the dotted lines and cut all the
heavy lines in the pattern. Push a burnt match, or a wooden
toothpick through one hub, then through an empty spool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and the second hub. The spool forms the wheels. Screw a
small pin cautiously through each of the two projecting ends
of the match, piercing the wood and leaving the head and
point of the pin standing out (<a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>). Tie a knot in the
end of a string to prevent its sliding out and thread it through
the hole in the dashboard.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 75&mdash;A Sunday-school room made of spools.</span>
</div>

<p>Leave an open space for the doorway at the opposite end of
the room from the organ. Build up a column of four large
spools at each side of the space and connect them with a strip
of paper laid from the top of one column to the top of the
other.</p>


<p>Build the fine, large pipe-organ close to the edge of the
back room. Stand eight spools in a row tight to each other
at equal distances from each boundary side line. Build the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
row up three spools high, then skipping the end spools, build
on two layers of six spools each; again skip the end spools
and build on a layer of four spools. Crown the last layer
with two top spools. Across the centre front of the organ
stand a row of spools, two high and three long. Over them
lay a piece of paper bent lengthwise through the centre for
the key-board and music-rack. Bend another piece of paper
for the music and stand it on the key-board against the rack.
Make the organ seat of two spools placed side by side in
front of the organ with a strip of paper laid over them. Let
the seats for the doll children be rows of three spools each.
Place the seats one in front of another in parallel lines a short
distance apart and allow a wide, lengthwise central aisle
between them. All this is shown in <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>.</p>



<h3>Trolley Car</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_76" id="Fig_76"></a>
<img src="images/i046.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Fig. 76&mdash;The spool trolley car." title="Fig. 76&mdash;The spool trolley car." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 76&mdash;The spool trolley car.</span>
</div>

<p>Hunt up an old pasteboard box, for you will need a box lid
about fifteen inches long and eight inches wide as a foundation
for the realistic trolley car (<a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>). Use eight spools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for the wheels; place two spool wheels near the front and
two near the back on each side. Lay the spools down flat
and rest the edge of the box lid on the body of the spools;
then stand a row of eleven spools on each side of the top of
the box lid. Beginning at one end of the row, build up
every other spool into three-spool columns; the intervening
spaces form the open windows of the car.</p>

<p>Leave windows on the opposite side of the car in the same
way, and place a row of spools close up against the bottom
spools of each side of the car to form the car seats. Roof the
car with a piece of cardboard cut off square at one end and
rounded at the other. On top of each side of this roof place
one row of six buttonhole-twist spools, the spools of each row
separated equal distances (<a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>). Stand a spool on the
front of the car platform for the motorman's wheel and you
have a car like that in the photograph.</p>

<p>When the trolley is taken apart use the spools in building</p>


<h3>A Bridge</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a> shows that the piers can be built to a good height
and be solid and substantial.</p>

<p>Stand three large-sized spools together, forming a triangle,
with one point turned to face the opposite pier. This group
of three spools is the foundation of one of the two columns,
which together form one pier of the bridge.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_77" id="Fig_77"></a>
<img src="images/i048a.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Fig. 77&mdash;The spool bridge." title="Fig. 77&mdash;The spool bridge." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 77&mdash;The spool bridge.</span>
</div>

<p>About two inches distant and on a line with the triangle
of spools stand a group of three more spools, and build up
each group into a column four spools high. You will need
two more columns for the opposite pier of the bridge; build
them as you did the first, and place the second pier exactly
opposite to and as far from the first as you desire the span
should reach&mdash;say about fourteen inches.</p>

<p>Lay a strip of pasteboard six inches wide across from pier
to pier, allowing the ends to rest on the piers, but not extend
beyond the outside end edges of the piers; then if your span<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is fourteen, inches long, cut from a pasteboard box two more
strips fourteen inches long and of the same width as the span;
score each strip across one end, one inch from the edge, bend
slightly and fit the bent edge of each strip on one end of the
bridge, allowing the other end of the strip to extend away
from the pier and rest on the floor, forming an inclined
approach to the bridge proper as in <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>.</p>


<p>When your pasteboard strips are well settled in place, continue
building up the piers on top of the pasteboard, making
each group of three spools
two layers high; then
build up one spool two
layers high on top of the
four columns.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="Fig_78" id="Fig_78"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 78&mdash;Span the two columns with this.</span>
</div>

<p>Complete the archway
by spanning the two columns
of each pier with
a narrow strip of stiff white paper bent up into a point at
the centre and out into a flap at each end (<a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a>). The flaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rest on top of the spools. The photograph shows how the
entire bridge should look, and in the photograph you will find
a little lady hurrying across the bridge on her way home, and
following in her wake Mr. Clothespin and Mrs. Clothespin.
A paper boat under the bridge would make the scene more
realistic.</p>

<p>Next build</p>


<h3>A Memorial Arch</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>), something like the one which was erected in New
York City. Commence with two groups of spools a short
distance apart; have three in each group, two in the back and
one in the front. Build up columns four spools high; then
lay a strip of pasteboard across from one to the other. On
top of the pasteboard place two more groups of smaller spools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a little nearer together than the first groups. Make these
columns two spools high and crown each with a single spool
decorated with a bright-colored paper flag fastened on a stick
pushed down into the spool. At the base of the arch add three
more spools on each side, <i>o</i> and <i>o</i> (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>), and the structure
will be completed. This is not exactly like the original, but
for a spool arch it is fine, and a spool procession will feel
honored to march through it.</div>

<h3>The Parthenon</h3>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 80&mdash;The Parthenon made of spools.</span>
</div>

<p>If you have enough spools, you can make a miniature representation
of one of the most beautiful temples ever built.
Begin by standing four spools in a row for the first end of the
building, allowing about the width of a spool between each
two. Place eight in a row for the first side, four for the
other end, and eight for the second side (<a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>). Have the
spools all of the same size, that the walls may be alike and
perfectly even, because, as you know, the walls are to be
formed of columns, not as many as in the original, but enough
to give an idea of the Greek temple. Build up the spools
three deep into pillars; then lay a piece of pasteboard on the
top of the columns for a ceiling. Bend another piece of pasteboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
lengthwise through the centre for the roof, and stand
it tent-like on top of the ceiling. You can measure the correct
size of the ceiling by laying a piece of pasteboard down flat
on the floor along the eight-columned side of the Parthenon
to obtain the length, and placing it flat on the floor across the
four-columned side to mark the width. Make the roof the
same length and a little wider than the ceiling, to allow for
the height of the bend through the centre.</p>


<p>You must imagine a space immediately beneath the roof
of the little Greek temple filled in with the most beautiful
statuary, and think of the spools as white marble columns,
and you should see, in fancy, another row of stately columns
inside the ones you have built. Tell all about the real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Parthenon and hunt up a picture of the temple that all may
see just how near you came to making the little model look
like the wonderful Parthenon on the Acropolis, in Athens.</p>

<p>After admiring the building for a while, pretend that a
left-over spool</p>


<h3>Is a Venetian Shell</h3>

<div class='unindent'>shot from a cannon, and toss it gently against the roof at one
end of the temple, then see the columns totter and fall, leaving
only a portion of the Parthenon standing, in the same way
that the real marble columns fell when the original structure
was shattered and practically destroyed by the soldiers.</div>

<p>You can</p>


<h3>Blow Bubbles with a Spool,</h3>

<div class='unindent'>beautiful bubbles, which float and glide in the air with all
the charm of clay-pipe bubbles. Mix strong soap-suds, dip
one end of a large spool in the water, wet the spool, then blow.
If the bubble refuses to appear, dip the spool in the water
again, put your head down to the spool and blow a few bubbles
while the spool is in the water, then quickly raise it and
try again. Nine times out of ten you will succeed, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
bubble will swell out from the spool as in <a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>. These
wooden bubble-blowers last a long time, with no danger of
breaking when accidentally dropped on the floor, and you
can always find enough to provide one for each of the players
who meet for a trial of skill in bubble-blowing.</div>

<h3>Pretty Butterflies</h3>

<div class='unindent'>which fly from spools. Cut a butterfly (<a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>) from bright-colored
tissue paper or thin writing paper, bend at the dotted
line and paste on the large end of a very small cork. Fit the
small end of the cork into the top of the hole of an empty
spool (<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>). Then blow through the spool and see the
butterfly ascend rapidly to the ceiling and float down again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
A number of different colored butterflies in the air at one
time fill the room with charming bits of fluttering brightness
that will delight the children.</div>

<p>Take another empty spool and stick a common wire hairpin
partially into the hole, bend the hairpin slightly down
against the edges of the hole, do the same with three more
hairpins, and you will have a spool with a funnel-like opening
of hairpins at the top (<a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a>). In the funnel place a small,
light-weight ball made of a crushed bit of bright paper wound
around with thread. Raise the spool to your lips and blow
gently (<a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>). The ball will rise and fall in mid-air, in the
same way that you have seen one of rubber dance at the top
of a small fountain or jet of water.</p>

<h3>The Frog</h3>

<p>The frog is one of the simplest and at the same time the
funniest of the collection. <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a> gives a side view in which
his beautiful open mouth can be seen to advantage. <a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a> shows him sprawled out on the table. <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a> gives the
pattern of the frog as it appears when drawn on the envelope.
You will notice that the bottom fold of the envelope
is used for the top of the animal. Draw the outlines
as in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>, then cut along the lines you have drawn. The
under part of the body follows the edge of the lower lap
of the envelope from front to hind leg. Now flatten out the
fold at the top and bend the paper under at the corners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which forms the head and tail. Cut a slit along the folded
edge of the head for the
mouth, pull the lower
part down and the mouth
will open wide as a frog's
mouth naturally does.
By working the lower
jaw the frog can be made
to snap at imaginary flies.
Draw the eyes as shown
in <a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a> and bend down
the lower part of the
body along the dotted line, shown in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>, spread out the
hind legs, and Master Frog is finished.</p>

<p>For the little bed (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>) use a long envelope. If the top
lap is open, cut it off. Flatten out the bottom fold as you did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for the frog's back, then bend the ends and sides as in <a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>. Bend up the points
at each end for head and
footboards, and there is
your bed.</p>


<h3>The Table</h3>

<p>Make the table (<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>) of a smaller envelope
in the same way, but
leave the points extending out at the ends (<a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>) and cut
short legs on the bottom edge (<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>).</p>

<p>Plates and other dishes can be made very easily. For
circular dishes use a cent or a ten-cent piece for a pattern.
Very effective cups and goblets can be made from old pieces
of tinfoil. The table, however, is strong enough to hold the
little china or tin dishes usually found among a child's collection
of toys.</p>

of a long envelope with the top left open. Fold the envelope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
into the box shape, as for the bed, with the points turned up.
Then fold the tips of the points inward, as in <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>. Now
reverse the box and slit down the two front edges which
gives an opening in
front. Bend down
this front piece and
cut it off on a line
with the two ends.</p>

<h3>The Arm-Chair</h3>

<p>A deep, low-seated
arm-chair can be
made of an oblong
envelope of ordinary
size by following the directions for the sofa and allowing the
back to curve instead of making it flat, then slitting down
the sides and bending them over to form the arms (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>).</p>

points are bent under, and the sides left to curve naturally.
A baby carriage can also be made in this way, but for the
carriage the points must extend down and have wheels drawn
on them and the tips must be cut off squarely at the bottom
so that the carriage will stand. The lap is the back and the
handle in one (<a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>).</p>

<h3>The Bungalow</h3>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 97&mdash;The bungalow is made of a long envelope.</span>
</div>

<p>The little bungalow (<a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>) is something very different,
yet it, too, is made of an envelope. Though it appears to
have many parts it is all in one piece. The envelope is a long
one, such as is used for
legal papers. <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>
gives the pattern. The
heavy lines show where
to cut and the dotted
lines where to bend. The
lap forms the front porch,
but the porch may be
left off entirely if the envelope
has been slit at
the top in opening it.
With a little care, however, many envelopes can be opened
intact. Cut along the heavy lines of the door and windows,
then open the door and the little shutters. Bend back the
ends of the house and in the middle of each end take a little
plait from top to bottom. This is to make the ends narrower
and give room for the roof to slant. Bend the roof back from
the eaves along the dotted line. The back of the bungalow
is made like the front, except that it has no door, windows, or
porch.</p>

<p>Children who have a knack at drawing can greatly improve
the bungalow by drawing the slats to the blinds, drawing in
the panelling on the front door, putting on the knob, putting
shingles on the roof, etc., etc.</p>

<h3>The Cart</h3>

<p>The little cart (<a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>), that will hold quite a heavy doll,
and can be trundled about like one made of wood, is not cut
at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_99" id="Fig_99"></a>
<img src="images/i061a.jpg" width="300" height="253" alt="Fig. 99&mdash;The cart can be trundled about like one made of wood." title="Fig. 99&mdash;The cart can be trundled about like one made of wood." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 99&mdash;The cart can be trundled about like one made of wood.</span>
</div>


<p>Fold an oblong envelope into the box shape (<a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>), with
points turned up, but let the points be deeper than for the
bed or sofa. This is because the ends of the envelope are to
form the sides of the cart and must be longer from front to
back. Bend the tips of the points in and crease the folds
sharply that they may lie flat against the sides. Sharpen
one end of a small, round stick and push it through the middle
of the folded point on one side, then slide a large, empty spool
on the stick and thrust the point of the stick through the
opposite side (<a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>). The stick should stand out beyond
the cart about half an inch on each side, and will need no
fastening.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 100&mdash;This is the way to put wheels on the cart.</span>
</div>
<p>Puncture a hole in one end of the cart, thread a cotton
string through the hole, tie a large knot on the inside end and
pull the string through until the knot presses close against the
end of the cart. Let the string be long enough to reach easily
from the floor to the little hand that will hold the other end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides all these toys, a baby's cradle that has rockers and
will rock, a cunning little dressing-table with its mirror, boxes
of different shapes and sizes, and various kinds of baskets
can be made of the old envelope. Probably there are other
forms it may be made to assume&mdash;boats perhaps, that for a
time at least will float on the water, and animals other than
the frog.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>TOYS OF CLOTHESPINS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> can make cunning, soft, downy hens and roosters
simply of raw cotton and clothespins (<a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>). The little
creatures may be pure white, dark colored, or part dark and
part light, according to the cotton used.</p>

<p>All of</p>


<h3>The Chickens</h3>

<div class='unindent'>have the same kind of foundation. It is made by sliding the
prongs of two clothespins into each other (<a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a>). Be
sure the clothespins, when together, stand firm on the prong
ends, for these form the legs and feet of the chickens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></div>

<p>With a string tie a piece of raw cotton over the head of one
clothespin; have the string tight, but the cotton cover rather
loose. Bring the cotton partly down the clothespin and tie
it again (<a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a>); then use your fingers to shape the top
cotton into the form of a rooster's head; gently pull a little
of it out to make the beak; tie a string around the beak where
it joins the head, and, with thumb and finger slightly dampened,
twist the end of the beak into a point (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>). Cotton
which comes in sheets is best for the tail, but the other will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
do. Lay the centre of a generous piece of cotton over the
head of the second clothespin, plait the loose ends around the
pin, and fasten with a string, making the edge of the tail in
a line with the opening of the prongs of the pin. Cut the
folded end rounded on top, and slit it up a short distance into
wide fringe to form the long feathers of the rooster's tail
(<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>).</p>

</table></div>
<p>With another piece of cotton cover the back and sides of the
rooster, as you would put a saddle on a horse. Bring the
edges of the cover together down the neck and body; when
fitted lift the cover, put paste here and there on its under side
near the edge, replace the cover and it will stick fast; then,
with the top of a wire hairpin, push the edges of the cover,
front and back, in between the open prongs of the clothespin.
Ink round bits of paper and paste on the rooster for eyes;
make his comb and wattles of red tissue paper (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>),
and you will have a fine rooster which can actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>Move His Little Cotton Head</h3>

<div class='unindent'>up and down, fast or slow, as you wish. To make him do so,
hold the front leg steady with your left hand, while with your
right hand you raise and lower the other leg. Try it, and see
how naturally the little fellow appears to pick up corn in an
eager, hungry manner.</div>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 106&mdash;The little hen.</span>
</div>


<p>Fashion the hen in the same way you made the rooster,
only have the tail smaller and without long feathers (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>).
The comb on the hen must also be smaller than that on the
rooster. The general shape of the hen is the same as that
of the rooster. Notice that the direction of outline along the
lower edge of tail and body is one continuous slanting line;
remember this when adjusting the tail that it may not stand
out backward at right angles from the body.</p>


<h3>The Little Lambs</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are made in much the same way as the chickens. Slide two
clothespins together for the foundation (<a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a>); tie a wad
of cotton over the head of one pin, then pull the head out a
trifle on each side for ears, and tie with a string as you made
the rooster's beak. Cover the second clothespin, making the
upper part, which extends down, quite thick; then lift the
upper part, and bring it across to the lamb's neck, for the
little animal must have an almost level back (<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>). Cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a piece of cotton large enough to cover the entire back and
sides of the lamb, lay it over the lamb like a very large saddle,
and fasten it in place with paste. Use small inked papers
for eyes, and tie a gay ribbon around his neck (<a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>).
Make a number of little lambs, for they are so attractive and
pretty grouped together (<a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>).</div>

<h3>The Rabbit</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_110">Fig. 110</a>) has the same kind of foundation as the lamb, but
stretched out more, bringing the heads of the pins lower and
farther apart. He needs very long ears, so they must be of
separate pieces of sheet cotton tied to the head. Make his
head rather large, and in other respects manufacture him
much the same as the lamb.</div>

<h3>The Ears and Tail of a Dog</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are too large for pulling out and tying from the main piece
of cotton, so cut them separate and tie on at the proper places.
Make the doggie's head large, and the saddle-like cover thick,
that the little fellow may be plump and fat; cut inked paper
for eyes and end of nose; with these exceptions the work
is the same as on the lamb (<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>).</div>

<p>When tying beaks, ears, and tails of the various animals,
cut the string ends close to the knot; then the string will sink
into the cotton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h3>Little Girl Doll,</h3>

<div class='unindent'>cut a strip of cotton extending from below the neck line of the
clothespin to within a short distance of the ends of the prongs;
tie the cotton in gathers around the lower edge of the neck,
and again lower down at the belt line (<a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>). Make
the arms of a strip of cotton about four and a quarter inches
long and one inch wide; slash in the middle a short distance,
and slip the strip over the head of the pin (<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>); bend at
the shoulders, fold remaining lengths once for arms, and, with
dampened thumb and finger, lightly twist the ends into hands.
The edges of the cotton forming arms and hands will cling
together. Tie a bright ribbon sash around Miss Dolly's
waist; then make her hair of a strip of dark raw cotton; fit
and press it on the wooden head, twisting the ends to resemble
long braids; pinch the cotton up on the top of the head to
form a pompadour; when adjusted take the wig off; cover
the wooden head with paste, and replace the wig, setting it
well back from the front of the head. Fasten a ribbon bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
back of the pompadour, and tie the braids together at the
nape of the neck with another ribbon; then ink the features.
Insert the ends of the prongs of the clothespin forming
dolly's feet into a small piece of double-faced corrugated
straw board, fasten them in with paste, and the little girl will
stand alone (<a href="#Fig_114">Fig. 114</a>). The doll's back is shown in <a href="#Fig_115">Fig. 115</a>.</div>

<h3>Boy Doll</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>) stand in the same manner; fashion his hair of dark
cotton, his trousers of a strip of white cotton tied around the
waist and pushed in between the prongs of the clothespins.
Cut the coat from a folded piece of cotton, a hole in the centre
of the fold for the head to pass through; straight sleeves horizontally
cut along the fold; and the remainder in sacque form
like a Japanese coat or pajamas. The sleeves form the arms
and the hands of the boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></div>

<p>Fasten a belt high at the back and low in the front around
his waist, giving the coat a Russian-blouse effect; make him
a ribbon bow necktie, and ink the features.</p>

<p>These small people are very bewitching, as are also the
animals.</p>

<p>You can color the sheet cotton slightly here and there with
water-color paint if you are clever with a paint brush. As you
work with these little dolls and animals you will find ever so
many ways to vary them in effect. They are so soft and
fluffy that a baby can play with them without injury, and a
school or college boy may be amused by being presented
with one, appropriately dressed, as a souvenir of pleasant
experiences at a college luncheon or dinner.</p>

<p>To make a foot-ball player, finish the blouse without necktie
or belt; make the shoulders wide and the hair rather short,
like a college boy's rough head. So much for the boy.
Paste a letter cut out of colored paper on the front of the
blouse to make it look like a college sweater, and gather the
trousers in a little at the knees. You can tuck an egg-shaped
ball made of brown raw wool under one arm for a
realistic touch, if you choose.</p>

<p>Little girl dolls may be similarly made to represent basket-ball
players in short skirts and school or college sweaters,
with appropriate emblems on the front, for a special entertainment.</p>

<p>Making these figures is much less trouble than dressing
dolls entails, and much more of a novelty, too. They take
so many shapes that they fit almost any occasion.</p>

<p>In fact, the possibilities of these cotton and clothespin toys
are almost endless in the hands of ingenious young people.</p>

</div>
<p>It is in the preparation of these pictures that you will find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the novelty of the plan I propose. Instead of pasting in
cards and pictures which have become too familiar to awaken
interest, let the young book-makers design and form their
own pictures by cutting special figures, or parts of figures,
from different cards, and then pasting them together so as
to form new combinations.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 214px;"><a name="Fig_122" id="Fig_122"></a>
<img src="images/i074b.png" width="214" height="400" alt="Fig. 122&mdash;Materials for Little Jack Horner." title="Fig. 122&mdash;Materials for Little Jack Horner." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 122&mdash;Materials for Little Jack Horner.</span>
</div>


<p>Any subject which pleases the fancy can be illustrated in
this way, and the children will soon be deeply interested in
the work and delighted at the strange and striking pictorial
characters that can be produced by ingenious combinations.</p>
<p>Stories and little poems may be very nicely and aptly
illustrated; but the "Mother Goose Melodies" are, perhaps,
the most suitable subjects with which to interest younger
children, as they will be easily recognized by the little folk.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the "Three Wise Men of Gotham," who
went to sea in a bowl. Will not <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a> serve very well as
an illustration of the subject? Yet these figures are cut from
advertising cards, and no two from the same card. <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>
shows the materials; <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a> shows the result of combining
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, the little man dancing so gaily (<a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>) is turned
into "Little Jack Horner" eating his Christmas pie (<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>),
by merely cutting off his legs and substituting
a dress skirt and pair of feet clipped from
another card. The Christmas pie in his lap
is from still another card.</p>

<p>In making pictures of this kind, figures
that were originally
standing may be forced
to sit; babies may be
placed in arms which, on
the cards they were stolen
from, held only cakes of
soap, perhaps, or boxes
of blacking; heads may
be ruthlessly torn from
bodies to which they belong,
and as ruthlessly
clapped upon strange
shoulders; and you will
be surprised to see what
amusing, and often excellent,
illustrations present themselves as the result of a little
ingenuity in clipping and pasting.</p>




<p>Another kind, which we shall call the</p>


<h3>Transformation Scrap-Book</h3>

<div class='unindent'>will be found exceedingly amusing on account of the various
and ever-changing pictures it presents.</div>

<p>Unlike any other, where the picture once pasted in must
remain ever the same, the transformation scrap-book alters
one picture many times. To work these transformations, a
blank book is the first article required; one eight inches long
by six and a half or seven wide is a good size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the pages of this book across, one-third the way down.
<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a> shows how this should be done. The three-cornered
piece cut out near the
binding allows the
pages to be turned
without catching or
tearing. Leave the
first page uncut; also
the one in the middle
of the book.</p>

<p>Cut from picture-cards,
or old toy-books
which have colored
illustrations, the
odd and funny figures of men and women, boys and girls,
selecting those which will give variety of costumes and
attitudes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig_123" id="Fig_123"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 123&mdash;Transformation scrap-book with pages cut.</span>
</div>

<p>Paste the figure of a woman or a girl on the first page,
placing it so that when the lower part of the next page is
turned the upper edge of it will come across the neck of the
figure where it is joined on to the shoulders.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 332px;"><a name="Fig_124" id="Fig_124"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 124&mdash;Leaves from a transformation scrap-book.</span>
</div>
<p>Cut the heads from the rest of the pictured women, turn the
lower part of the next page and, choosing a body as different
as possible from the one just used, paste it upon the lower part
of the second page, directly under the head belonging to the
first body. Upon the upper part of the second page paste
any one of the other heads, being careful to place it so that
it will fit the body. Continue in this way, pasting the heads
upon the upper, and the bodies on the lower, part of the page,
until the space allowed for the women is filled up; then,
commencing at the page left in the middle of the book, paste
upon it the figure of a man, and continue in the same manner
as with the women, until the spaces are all used and the book
is complete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>The combinations formed in this way are very funny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Old heads with young bodies; young heads with old bodies;
then one head with a great variety of bodies, and so on.</p>

<p>The first picture may represent a man, tall, thin, dressed
in a rowing costume, as shown in the illustration. Turn the
lower part of the next page, and no longer is he thin and tall,
but short and stout, the position of this body giving the expression
of amazement, even to the face. The next page
turned shows him to be neither tall nor short, thick nor thin,
but a soldier, well-proportioned, who is looking over his
shoulder in the most natural manner possible (<a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>).</p>



<p>The figures in <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a> were cut from advertising cards,
and the head belongs to none of the bodies.</p>

<p>A curious fact in arranging the pictures in this way is that
the heads all look as though they might really belong to any
of the various bodies given them.</p>

<p>Instead of having but one figure on a page, groups may be
formed of both men and women, and in the different arrangement
of the figures they can be made very ludicrous
indeed.</p>


<h3>Flour Paste</h3>

<p>Mix one-half cup of flour with enough cold water to make
a very thin batter, which must be smooth and free from
lumps; put the batter on top of the stove&mdash;not next to the
fire&mdash;in a tin saucepan, and stir continually until it boils;
then remove from the stove, add three drops of oil of cloves,
and pour the paste into a cup or tumbler. This will keep for
a long time and will not become sour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>TOYS MADE OF COMMON KINDLING WOOD</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> a glance at a pile of ordinary every-day kindling wood
could hardly suggest to one the possibilities existing in the
crude material for building all sorts of interesting and realistic
things for the little folks, but experiment and you will find
that Klondike log-houses, rail-fences and lumber camps,
bridges, and substantial little rafts which will float on water
in laundry or bath tub, pond or stream, can be easily and
readily built from the little sticks we use to start our fires.</p>

<p>Let us build</p>


<h3>The Bridge</h3>

<div class='unindent'>first, that Indians and men may cross the water to the lumber
region beyond, and cut logs for their rafts (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>).</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_125" id="Fig_125"></a>
<img src="images/i079.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="Fig. 125&mdash;The little bridge built of kindling wood." title="Fig. 125&mdash;The little bridge built of kindling wood." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 125&mdash;The little bridge built of kindling wood.</span>
</div><p>Select two sticks of kindling wood as near of a size as you
can find, and lay them side by side, a short distance apart;
then connect the two by placing sticks across the ends, log-cabin
fashion. These four sticks form the square foundation
of one bridge pier.</p>

<p>Continue building by crossing the second layer of sticks
with a third layer, the third layer with a fourth layer, and
so on until the pier is built up sufficiently high, six or more
layers, according to the thickness of the sticks. As you
build be sure that the two sticks forming each layer lie absolutely
steady and are of about the same thickness, that those
built on top of them may not slant, but lie level and steady.</p>

<p>All sticks should be of the same length, but the layers may
vary in thickness; one layer of sticks might be thin and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
next thick; it matters not, provided that the two forming the
same layer are nearly of a size.</p>



<p>When the first pier is finished, build a second one like it a
short distance from the first one, and lay a strip of stiff pasteboard,
cut from an old box, across from pier to pier; then lay
a second strip of pasteboard from one pier to the ground, a
third strip from the remaining pier to the ground on the opposite
side (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>). If you wish, the two end strips can
be longer than those shown in the photograph, and slant from
the piers down to the ground on a level with the water. The
banks in the photograph are built up with boxes and covered
with green cloth.</p>

<p>For each of the two archways, take two thin sticks of wood
and stand them at the top outward edge of the pier, with
ends braced together at the top, and spread out at the bottom,
as in the photograph.</p>

<p>Use either natural or tissue-paper trees stuck into empty
spools for foliage, or little toy trees, if you happen to have
them among the children's store toys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the bridge is not intended to be over real water,
you might try the experiment and strengthen the hollow piers
by filling them with stones, when building the bridge out-of-doors.</p>

<h3>Kindling-Wood Rafts</h3>

<div class='unindent'>which will float on real water. Have the slender sticks for
the raft all of the same length, and use about sixteen or eighteen
sticks for each raft. Weave them together with a string.
Begin by tying the centre of a long string around each end of a
stick, which should be about eight inches in length (<a href="#Fig_127">Fig. 127</a>).</div>

</table></div>
<p>Place one end of a second stick up against one tie, allowing
one string to come over and the other string under the second
stick (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>). Cross the two lengths of the string over the
second stick, bringing the lower string up and the upper
string down (<a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>); then lay another stick up against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the crossed strings, carrying the strings in turn over this stick
(<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>). Again, bring the lower string up and the upper
string down, before placing another stick. Continue crossing
the string and adding kindling wood until the raft is of the
desired length. Tie the ends of the string securely on the
last stick, and weave the opposite loose ends of the sticks
together in the same way, tying the string firmly together on
the last stick. Clip off the ends of the string and the raft
will then be ready for the water, and will carry either passengers
or freight.</p>

<div class='unindent'>that the buildings may be longer one way than the other.
They will look better and be more comfortable than if square.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></div>

<p>Place two long sticks of kindling wood a short distance
apart and running parallel; across these sticks lay two
shorter ones, bridging the space at each end between the long
sticks, then place two long sticks over the ends of the two
short ones; keep building in this way until the little house is
seven or eight layers high.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of white cardboard or light-weight pasteboard
the length of the house, and wider than the width of the house,
to allow for the slant of the roof. Bend the roof lengthwise
through the centre and lay it on top of the house (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>).
Make a door of stiff pasteboard painted or covered with a
layer of brown tissue-paper pasted on the outside. Cut the
door a suitable size and stand it up in front of the house.</p>

<p>If you want</p>


<h3>An Arctic Scene</h3>

<div class='unindent'>spread a piece of white cloth over a table for the snowy
ground. Canton flannel, fleecy side up, is best, but any kind
will answer the purpose. Then erect several kindling-wood
houses and form a Klondike settlement (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>).</div>

<p>Original home-made toy men, dogs, and sled may be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to complete the scene, or they can be cut from newspapers
or old magazines. Stiffen by pasting them on cardboard;
then cut out the men, dogs, and sled more carefully in detail.
Bend one leg forward and one backward to make the men
stand alone, and bend two legs outward and two inward to
enable the dogs to stand. Paste narrow strips of paper on the
dogs for harness.</p>

<h3>Rail-Fences</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are peculiar to America. You cannot find them abroad, and
every little boy and girl will want to know how to build one
of these old-fashioned "snake" or Virginia rail-fences. The
fence may be of any length, its zigzag lines can run in any
direction, all the way across the room if you choose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></div>

</div></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Lay down one piece of kindling wood, and over one end
place the end of another stick, forming a rude letter V (<a href="#Fig_133">Fig. 133</a>). Across the end of the second stick which rests on the
ground, place the end of a third stick (<a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a>). Keep on
building the first layer of the fence in this way until it stretches
as far as you wish; then go back to the starting point and
begin building the second layer of sticks, by placing a stick
over the first stick, resting one end on the far end of the first
stick, the other end on the top of the end of the second stick;
lay another stick across over the second stick, another over
the third, and so on until the second layer is finished. Build
other layers in like manner, and make the fence high or low,
as desired. Pile up kindling wood into a wood-pile with
small pieces scattered on the ground, and if there is a toy
horse you can make him haul more wood (<a href="#Fig_132">Fig. 132</a>).</p>

<p>These kindling-wood toys will give a realistic idea of log-houses,
rail-fences, log rafts, and primitive bridges, and while
building them the children might be told stories of the way
early settlers lived and made their homes, or the children may
"make up" stories about the different scenes.</p>


<h3>Hammocks</h3>

<p>Substantial little hammocks which will hold good-sized
dolls, and even a real pussy with no danger of the material
breaking, can be made of ordinary kindling wood or strips of
pasteboard (<a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>). Both styles of hammocks are woven
in the same manner. The weaving is like that used for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
raft and is of the simplest, most primitive kind, merely crossing
of the two ends of each side string between each piece of
wood (or pasteboard) slat, with loops of string left at each
end of the hammock for hanging it up. When fashioned of
kindling wood, like that in the photograph, have the sticks
slender and all of the same length. When made of pasteboard,
cut seven-inch-wide strips from a heavy pasteboard box and
cut the strips crosswise into one-half-inch slats. Have ready
two long strings measuring about two and a half yards each.
Double each string and tie a knot in the closed end, fifteen
inches from the extreme folded end, then place your work on
the top of the table, or some other flat surface where you can
keep the slats flat and even. Begin to weave by laying a
slat between the loose ends of each string.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_135" id="Fig_135"></a>
<img src="images/i085.png" width="400" height="196" alt="Fig. 135&mdash;A substantial little hammock." title="Fig. 135&mdash;A substantial little hammock." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 135&mdash;A substantial little hammock.</span>
</div>

<p>Push the slat up tight against the knots and cross the strings
on the outer edge of the slat. Slide another slat between the
two ends of each side string, shoving it close up against the
crossed strings at the outer edge of the first slat. Bring one
end of each string over and one under the second slat, cross
them, and add the third slat. Continue weaving in this way
until the hammock is of sufficient length, then tie the strings
securely at the outer edge of the last slat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>After you have put in the last board bring the slats up very
close together and draw the strings firm and tight. Tie the
double lengths of string together at each end of the hammock,
making two long loops by which to hang up the hammock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>LITTLE TWIG PEOPLE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you seen the little people who live up in the trees?
Little twig people who dance and swing and bob about, who
nod and bow and flutter hither and yon; some astride funny
twig horses, others dangling head down, many waiting to
run a race when a stiff breeze comes along, and all as merry
as merry can be, tossing their long, thin arms and legs in the
air just for the fun of it. Perhaps some of these queer folk
are outside your window now, and it may be near enough to
the ground for even the littlest boys and girls to reach if they
stand on their toes. Here are several of the twig people who
came down and posed for their photographs. We will give
each one a name.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a> is Miss Daffy-down-dilly, who has just come to
town and is feeling very bashful about it.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a> is Jack-be-nimble Jack-be-quick, who thinks he
can jump over any candlestick, high or low.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a> is the Little Crooked Man who ran a crooked
mile.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a> is Little Miss Muffet, who is so terribly afraid of
the spider.</p>

<p>The little twig people do not look quite as real when
separated from the tree as when you see them dancing in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
breeze, so it is necessary to help out their appearance with
paper heads and hands and feet.</p>

<p>Use care in selecting your twigs, for they are not all alike.
Some are quite choice and unique, others more commonplace
and less amusing. Suitable ones may be found in plenty.</p>

<p>When a small branch is broken from a tree or bush, you
will find that some of the twigs attached look like queer,
crooked, little legs, and some, just the right distance above,
seem made for arms. Then comes the long neck that is
joined, perhaps, to the still larger branch or to the trunk of
the tree. Sometimes there are several arms and several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
legs too many and you must look closely and decide which
are the real ones; then cut off the others.</p>

<p>You will know the real</p>


<h3>Arms and Legs</h3>

<div class='unindent'>for they are always the funniest ones and the most suggestive
of comical action.</div>

<p>Cut the long neck down in proportion to the rest of the
body and trim the arms and legs off to the proper length.
Remember that one inch of the neck of the dolls must be
inserted in the head and allow for that in cutting the long stem.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_136">Fig. 136</a> gives a branch as it looks when taken from the
tree, and the black bands on the twigs show where they should
be trimmed off to bring the little figure into proportions.
The parts left white or in outline, below the bands, are to be
cut away. There are two legs to this branch and three arms,
one of which must be dispensed with. The left arm must
remain and it matters but little which of the right arms is
selected. In this case the lower one is marked to be cut.</p>

<p>Now comes the making of the</p>


<h3>Heads, Hands, and Feet</h3>

<p>These must all be double, for, to hold them on, the twigs are
pasted between the two halves. In some cases, where the
neck is quite thick, you will find it best to shave off a little
at front and back to flatten it, so that the neck may lie easily
between the two parts of the head and not push the face out
of shape (<a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>). This is seldom necessary, however,
unless the doll is unusually large.</p>

<h3>Daffy-Down-Dilly</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is quite a tall girl, standing eighteen inches high in her heel-less
shoes (<a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>). Her head, shown in <a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>, measures
three inches from top to chin; this does not include the
swirl of hair which rises in a peak above the head. Her
hands, A (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), are two and a quarter inches long from
wrist to tip of middle finger,
and her feet, B (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>),
are two and three-quarter
inches long.</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;"><a name="Fig_145" id="Fig_145"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 145&mdash;Daffy-down-dilly.</span>
</div>

<p>These are the proportions.
Of course, for a smaller doll
they should be smaller.</p>

<p>Fold a piece of wrapping
paper, making it double,
and on the paper draw Daffy's
head, copying the one in
<a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>, or making an original
head if you prefer. The
back hair may be drawn in or
painted if the children insist
upon having an all-around
doll. If the neck is thick shave it off as in <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>. Draw
two hands on double pieces of paper and two feet on double
pieces of paper, and cut them out. Daffy's hands are the
color of her face, and her shoes are black.</p>


<p>Now cover the inside of the back of the head with paste,
lay the neck on the head and cover that too with paste (<a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>). Then fit the front of the head to the back and press
it down until the two halves, with the twig between, are pasted
firmly together. In the same way paste on the hands and
feet. Make Daffy's dress of yellow tissue-paper, the color<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of a daffodil. Cut a circle for the skirt with a small hole in
the centre and slit it down the back;' then draw it through
your hands to shape it and make it hang nicely.</p>

<p>Cut out a little waist with pointed sleeves, like <a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>,
and a pointed collar, like <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>. Make the waist double
with the fold at the top, cut a hole for the neck, and slit down
the back. Use green tissue-paper for the collar.</p>

<p>Put the waist on the doll, gather it at the belt line, front and
back, and paste. Paste it also at the neck and along the under
edge of the sleeves. Paste the skirt to the waist at the belt,
bring the edges of the slit together at the back, lap them, and
paste. Wrap a strip of the yellow paper around the waist
for a belt, then put the collar around the neck, and fasten with
a touch of paste.</p>

D (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>) the pattern for his feet, which are made of
brown paper. His brilliant costume is fashioned of orange-colored
tissue-paper. Cut the coat like <a href="#Fig_149">Fig. 149</a>, making it
double, with the fold at the top of the high flaring collar.
Cut a hole for the neck and make a small slit down in front,
then turn back the points of the collar at the neck. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
avoid slitting the coat all the way to the bottom, put it on
little Jack before you adjust his head. His neck can be
slipped through the hole without trouble; then the edges
of the coat are pasted together. Each leg of the short
trousers is made separately,
of an oblong piece of
tissue-paper. This is gathered
at the knee and waist
line and pasted in place
(<a href="#Fig_150">Fig. 150</a>). If the stripes on
Jack's cap are painted orange
color and his pointed
shoes are also orange, the
effect of his bright costume
will be still more glowing.</div>

<h3>The Little Crooked Man</h3>

<div class='unindent'>belongs to the fir-tree family,
and as he is clothed
only in his little rough suit
of brown bark, you can see (<a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a>) how the twigs grow
that form his arms and legs. These are in such positions
and have such peculiar curves he would look as if running
even without hands and feet, but the proper adjustment of
hands as well as feet emphasizes the action. Both are
turned in the direction in which he is going, and one foot is
lifted while the other rests on its heel, giving the stepping-forward
effect.</div>

<div class='unindent'>the largest of the dolls (<a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a>), is twenty inches high. Her
head (<a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a>) measures four inches from top to chin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
four inches across at its widest part. Her hands are made of
brown paper, like F (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), and her high-heeled shoes, like
G (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), are black. Her head is tilted to one side and
the thumbs of both hands turn in.</div>






<p>You can make Miss Muffet's dress any color you like, the
brighter and gayer the better. Cut the skirt and waist as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you did for Daffy-down-dilly, but do not point the sleeves.
Make an apron of two squares of white tissue-paper&mdash;a large
and a small one. Use the large square for the skirt of the
apron and the small square for the bib. Gather the top edge
of the large square and the bottom edge of the small square,
and paste to the dress at the belt line; then make a white
belt and tie in a bow at the back.</p>

<p>For the hat, cut a circle of tissue-paper the color of the
dress, put a little paste in the centre, and pinch it down on the
top loop of Miss Muffet's hair, tipping it a little to one side.
This will give a crown. Turn up the brim at the back and
lift it in front to stand out straight. Fringe a small piece of
black paper for a feather and paste it to the crown of the hat.</p>

stem, to which the smaller twigs are attached, forms his neck,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
body, and left leg, and is so large that both neck and ankle
had to be shaved off somewhat before his head and left shoe
could be pasted on. Originally the twig that forms his left
arm extended beyond the joint at the elbow, but it was cut
off, and the smaller twig was allowed to remain to give the
comical bend to the arm which adds greatly to the appearance
of the haste and the swinging arms of a pedestrian.</div>

<p>Peter White's head is given in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>. His brown hands
are cut like H (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), and his black shoes like I (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>).</p>

<p>This doll is the only one whose head is in profile, but it
shows that when the shape of the twig suggests it, a profile
is very effective; and it is usually the easiest for children to
draw.</p>


<h3>Doctor Foster</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is also ten inches high (<a href="#Fig_154">Fig. 154</a>). His head, with smiling
face, is given in <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>. His
brown paper hands are cut
like J (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), and his black
shoes like E (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>). He
wears his trousers quite short,
that they may not get wet in the
famous Gloster puddle, or if
they do they will dry quickly.
The trousers are made of
wrapping paper, double, of course, and pasted together at
the edges after they have been adjusted. They are cut like

<p>Place two of the cards together and cut two slashes, one on

on top, while the divisions B and B of the other card will
come over on the outside (<a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>). Fasten all of the
remaining cards together in pairs in the same manner; then
cut a long slit near the outer edge of each of the four pairs of
cards, C and C (<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>). Slide the walls together at right
angles, and form a square by means of the long slits. Do this
by holding the open end of one long slit in one wall under, and
at right angles to the open end of one long slit in another wall,
and then fitting the two walls into each other so that they will
stand firm and form one corner of the lower story of the
house (<a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>).</p>

</div><p>Make the ceiling of the lower story of two more pairs of
cards fastened together like <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>, and on the ends of each
pair of cards cut similar divisions, only have them quite short
(<a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>). Bend down
all of the end divisions
and fit the strips over
across the top of the
first story from front to
back, bringing the two
corner divisions, D and
D (<a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>), on the outside
of the wall, while
you slide the centre part, E, on the inside (<a href="#Fig_162">Fig. 162</a>). Dotted
lines indicate the division E on the inside.</p>



<p>The second story must be built entire before it can be fastened
on top of the first story.</p>

<p>Make each of the four walls of the second story three cards
long. Cut divisions on both ends of the middle card to fit
in the end cards (<a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>).</p>

<p>When cutting divisions, always fit together the two cards
that are to be joined, and cut through the double layer, which
will insure having the divisions alike.</p>

<p>When the four walls are ready to be put together, cut a
window in the two end cards of the wall which you intend
for the front (<a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>). Only the lower edge and sides of the
window may be cut; the upper edge is merely bent and throws
the solid window shutter, formed of the piece cut, outward,
as shown in the photograph.</p>

<p>Slide the four walls together and add a fifth wall, to run
through the centre from side to side, for strength. Use the
long slit method for joining the centre wall to the side walls.</p>

<p>When built, turn the second story upside down and fit a
strip of three cards, bridge-like, over the centre from front to
back, and fasten it to the bottom of the walls as you attached
the ceiling of the first story; then fit on another strip in like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
manner over the centre from side to side, and fasten it to the
bottom of the side walls. The two strips will cross each
other at their centres, one lying at right angles over the other.</p>

<p>Make the projecting roof of the second story of four strips
of four cards each. Run the strips from side to side of the
house and lap them a trifle, one over the other. The roof

<p>The peak is made of two strips of two cards each, and slid
into a base of one strip of three cards by means of long
slits. At the apex the cards are also fastened together with
long slits.</p>

<p>The little summer-house in <a href="#Fig_156">Fig. 156</a> has each of the four
sides made of one card. The cards are fastened together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by means of long slits. A doorway opening is cut in the front
wall, much in the same manner as the windows are cut in the
large house, only in this case the incision is made directly on
the lower edge of the card, and, when finished, the lower half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the door is cut off. The door is bent outward and forms a
little canopy for the open doorway, as in the photograph.</p>

<p>Make the roof of two strips of cards of two cards each by
merely laying the strips across the top opening of the house.</p>

<p>Fasten the ends of the two cards together with long slits
to form the apex of the peak, and bend the bottom ends of the
cards out flat, so the peak will stand steady on the roof.</p>

<p>If the children would like to keep the buildings intact to
play with at any future time, as they build up the structures
let them add a little glue or strong paste here and there to hold
the various parts firmly together. The toys will then last
a long time and stand considerable wear.</p>

<p>Tissue-paper trees in spools furnish the foliage in the
photograph, while a miniature flag, with its pole supported
in an empty spool, shows the nation to which the country
belongs.</p>

<p>Cut little paper people from cardboard and place them on
the grounds.</p>

<p>A fine setting for the scene can be made by tacking a piece
of green canton flannel, fleecy side uppermost, taut over a
pastry board, or pinning it on a piece of the light-weight
patent straw pasteboard.</p>

<p>The fleecy green gives the appearance of grass, and when
the glistening white buildings are set down on the grass
among the trees with Old Glory floating overhead, and gaily
dressed dolls in the foreground, the children will be delighted
with the scene; nor will the appreciation be confined to the
children, for older people will also enjoy it.</p>

<h3>The Pagoda</h3>

<div class='unindent'>in <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a> is extremely easy to build. Make the base square
of four cards fastened together with long slits. On this
foundation build up one card on the front and one on the
back, by cutting two short slits on the lower edge of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
lengthwise bottom of the cards, one slit near each end
(<a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a>), and sliding one card across the front on the uncut
top edges of the sides of the foundation by means of the slits;
then fastening the other card across
the back from side to side in like
manner. On top of these two cards
build two more, reaching across the
sides from front to back. Continue
building in this way until the pagoda
is ten stories high. The projections
along the sides are made of two long
narrow cards each, the two cards fastened together at the
centre like <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>; then the ends are bent up and the strip
laid across from side to side on the top edge of the two side
cards which form every other story. The apex roof is built
of two cards with the top edges fastened together, tent-like,
by means of long slits, on a foundation strip of two cards
bent up at the ends.</div>

</div>
<div class='unindent'>in <a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a> is also made of visiting cards. Take two long,
narrow cards, place them together, and about one-third the
distance from one end of the double layer cut a slit through
the two cards, extending it a little more than half-way across
the cards; then take the cards apart and slide them into each
other. Be sure that the two short ends of the cards come
together. Open out the two short ends tent-fashion, and
bend down one of the long ends across its centre for the seat,
leaving the other long end erect to form the back of the chair
for the paper doll (<a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>). Make several chairs; then
make the dressing-table. Place two long cards evenly together
and cut a slash through and more than half-way
across the centre of the two cards. Slide the cards together,
making an X. Bend out the top and bottom ends of the X<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
flat. For the top of the table select a rather large card, but
not too wide. Cut one slash on each side of the centre of one
of the lengthwise edges. This will make three divisions.
Cut corresponding slashes, but much deeper, in one of the
short ends of a smaller card, which is to be the mirror. Trim
off the end of the middle division in the table top and slide
the two cards together, bringing the B and B divisions (<a href="#Fig_157">Fig. 157</a>) of the mirror well forward, so that the top of the table
extends back beyond the mirror; then bend up the B and B
divisions of the mirror, as in the photograph. Place the top
with the mirror attached on the X, allowing the X to come
back directly under the mirror in order that the top may be
steady. If you paste a piece of silver paper or tinfoil well
smoothed out on the card for the mirror, the dressing-table
will, from a little distance, appear quite realistic.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>PLAYING INDIANS WITH COSTUMES MADE OF NEWSPAPERS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best framework for a newspaper wigwam can be made
of long-handled feather dusters, but long-handled brushes, or
poles of any kind you may happen to have, will answer the purpose;
all that is necessary
is something
you can make into a
framework similar to
<a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>. Tie your
poles together at the
top and spread them
out at the base, tent-fashion.</p>

<p>Make the</p>


<h3>Covering for the Wigwam</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of six large double
sheets of newspaper
pasted together.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;"><a name="Fig_168" id="Fig_168"></a>
<img src="images/i106.png" width="331" height="350" alt="Fig. 168&mdash;Framework for wigwam." title="Fig. 168&mdash;Framework for wigwam." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 168&mdash;Framework for wigwam.</span>
</div>

<p>Only three poles will be needed when the covering is of
newspaper, but if you do not happen to have enough newspapers
on hand for the entire outfit of tepees and costumes,
you can use a white muslin sheet for the wigwam, in which
case four poles will be needed (<a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a>). The sheet, not
being stiff like the paper, requires more supports to make it
stand out sufficiently. Should it be inclined to fall in between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the poles, pull it out a little and lay a book over the edge
which lies on the floor, as a weight, to keep the sheet in place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;"><a name="Fig_169" id="Fig_169"></a>
<img src="images/i107.jpg" width="391" height="400" alt="Fig. 169&mdash;Look at our newspaper Indian costumes. We are playing Indians." title="Fig. 169&mdash;Look at our newspaper Indian costumes. We are playing Indians." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 169&mdash;Look at our newspaper Indian costumes. We are playing Indians.</span>
</div>

<p>If you would like the wigwam decorated in real Indian
fashion, cut out large colored paper pictures and paste them
around the lower part of the wigwam, forming a band of
pictures. Be the covering either cloth or paper, it will look
well decorated, but the covering must be taken off and the
pictures pasted on. The covering should then be adjusted
over the poles. One great beauty and attraction of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
newspaper Indian material is that effective results can be
produced quickly and with little work.</p>

<p>Make</p>


<h3>Moccasins</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of newspaper, cut like the pattern (<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>). For a small
pair the paper should measure fifteen inches in length and
three and a half inches in width; larger sizes require larger
paper.</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_170" id="Fig_170"></a>
<img src="images/i108.png" width="300" height="76" alt="Fig. 170&mdash;Cut moccasins this way." title="Fig. 170&mdash;Cut moccasins this way." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 170&mdash;Cut moccasins this way.</span>
</div>

<p>Fringe the central portion of the longest edge according to
the fringe lines on <a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>. Cut the two boundary lines of
fringe, A and A, up to the dotted line; then bend down all
dotted lines. Bring the two ends together, allowing the fringe
to come on the outside, and fit the point B over the other point
B. This finishes the newspaper moccasin (<a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a>).</p>

<p>Make</p>


<h3>The Little Dress Skirt</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of two newspapers pasted together along the shortest edge,
then folded lengthwise through the centre, and the two lower
loose ends cut into a deep fringe. This skirt needs no belt;
it should be simply fastened together at the back over the
ordinary dress with safety-pins.</div>

<p>Use one sheet of paper for the little fringed sacque. Allow
the paper to remain folded along the white central band, and
fold the double layers crosswise through the centre, making
four thicknesses. Cut an opening for the head according to
dotted line C (<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>). Fringe the sides along dotted line
D, as shown in diagram (<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfold carefully, that the paper may not tear, and after
cutting a slit from the neck partially down the centre of the
front, you will have <a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a>. If you wish to make the garment
less liable to tear, paste narrow strips of muslin on the under
side of the sacque, around the neck, down each side of the
slit, and at the head of the fringe.</p>

the straight edge of
the band at the

charming little squaw will be ready to play in the wigwam
(<a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a>).</p>

<p>Older girls can make the Indian costume from the same
patterns by cutting them larger.</p>

<p>The Indian boy needs a lot of fringed newspaper for his
costume. Cut folded strips to make the fringe thick and in
two layers. Fold down the solid edge of one strip and
with safety-pins fasten the fold along the outside line of the
boy's trousers and stockings, as in the photograph (<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>). Trim the other trouser leg and stocking in the same
manner.</p>

<h3>Feather Head-Dress</h3>

<div class='unindent'>cut a folded strip of newspaper long enough to encircle the
boy's head and allow for a lap&mdash;twenty-two inches will
probably be correct. Make the strip six inches wide; the
tops of the feathers must be along the folded edge. Let the
feathers be fully four inches high, and allow a space of one
inch on the band at the base of each feather, F (<a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>).
The widest part of each feather should be one and three-quarters
inches. Make the band four thicknesses by folding
it over at the dotted line; then crease each separate feather on
the right side lengthwise, through the centre, to stiffen them
and insure their standing erect. Cut another long strip of
feathers in the same way, to fall from the head down the back.
On this strip paste the front and back of each feather together
at its base. Also paste together lengthwise the upper portion
of the band, and, instead of folding as you did the first band,
separate and open out its two lower lengthwise halves.
Crease them backward away from each other, so that the
feathers may stand erect and the band be at right angles on
each side of the feathers (<a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a>).</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a></span> is the photograph of a Christmas tree whose
trimming is entirely home-made. The brilliant colors and
shining gilt of the papers used, give a sparkle and life that are
most captivating, and the ornaments are so easily made that
the children themselves can do much toward decorating a
tree in this manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>At the top of the tree, shining above all other ornaments, is</p>


<h3>The Christmas Star</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a>), and this is the way to make it:</div>

<p>From a piece of cardboard cut an oblong with the top and
bottom edges five and a quarter inches long and the side
edges just five inches long (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>). Now, exactly in the
middle at the top edge, make a dot, A (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>); then on
each side edge make a dot, BB (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>). On the bottom
edge, one inch from each
bottom corner, make the
dots CC. With the aid of a
ruler draw the lines connecting
these points, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>. This
gives a perfect five-pointed
star, five inches high. Cut
the star out, cover its entire
surface with a coat of
paste, and lay over it a
smooth piece of gilt paper,
pressing out the fulness
and creases. When the
paste is dry, cut away the paper from the edges, and there
will remain a gilt star, firm and stiff enough to stand up
bravely.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 254px;"><a name="Fig_185" id="Fig_185"></a>
<img src="images/i115.png" width="254" height="250" alt="Fig. 185&mdash;Draw the star like this." title="Fig. 185&mdash;Draw the star like this." />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 185&mdash;Draw the star like this.</span>
</div>

<p>But this is not all. There are to be a number of gold-tipped
rays flaming out from the star to represent its spreading
light. For these rays select ten broom straws with two
prongs. Trim the prongs evenly, shorten the stems at the
bottom, and spread the prongs apart (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>). Now, cut
twenty strips of gold paper half an inch wide and a little
over four inches long. Lay one strip down, cover the wrong
side with paste, place three broom straws with their prongs
resting on the paste side of the paper, and press another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
strip of gold paper over the first, inclosing the tips of the
straws. This will give a gold paper on both sides of the
straws. Then, when the paste is dry, cut away the paper,
leaving a gold triangle on the tip of each prong of each
broom straw. <a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a> shows one triangle cut out. Treat
all of your broom-straw rays in this way, then cover with
paste the centre of the wrong side of the star up to the points,
lay two straws in place, the
stems crossing, as in <a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>,
and over the stems press a
short strip of white paper, like
D (<a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>), pasting it down
securely. Adjust the other
rays between the points of the
star, and fasten in place in the
same manner.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 188&mdash;Paste the straws on the star.</span>
</div>

<p>To hold the star upright,
make a lighter from a strip of
white writing-paper for a stem.
Flatten the top of the lighter,
cut it off evenly, and paste it
on the back of the star between the two lower points, as in
<a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>. Over the stems of the broom straws and the end of
the lighter paste a white paper lining that will reach part
way up each point of the star. This lining should be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
before the rays are pasted to the star, by laying the star on
white paper, tracing around its edges with a pencil, cutting
out the white paper star, and then clipping off about one inch
of the points. The gold star will look like <a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a>.</p>


<p>Not the least effective trimmings on the tree are the little</p>


<h3>Christmas Bells</h3>

<div class='unindent'>that hang by strings from the tips of the branches and dangle
alluringly. They are of different sizes, and some are made
of gilt, others of colored paper (<a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></div>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 189&mdash;The Christmas bells that dangle alluringly.</span>
</div>


<p>For a bell three and a half inches high (a very good size),
cut a strip of paper three and a half inches wide and seven
inches long, curve it into the cone shape shown in <a href="#Fig_190">Fig. 190</a>,
and pin together. Cut off the point that laps over, according
to the dotted line, also the point that laps under, leaving a
little over half an inch for the final lap. Trim off the bottom
points even with the shortest part of the bottom edge, as
shown by the curved, dotted line, and you will have <a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>.
<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a> opened out will give you <a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a>, which will be the
pattern for other bells.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 193&mdash;Cut out two disks at one time.</span>
</div>

<p>As <a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a> lies flat on the table, run the paste brush along
one side edge, making the coat of paste as wide as the lap is
to be, then curve the bell into shape. Make the bottom
edges meet evenly and press the paste-covered edge over the
other side edge. Hold the finger inside the bell while you do
this, to keep it from flattening.</p>



<p>The clapper is made of two round disks of gold paper with
the string pasted between them. For the bell we are now
making, the clapper should be almost one inch in diameter.
Fold a piece of gilt paper and cut out the two disks at one
time (<a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a>). Cover the wrong side of one disk with
paste, lay the end of a string across the middle (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>),
and press the other disk on top. Both sides of the clapper
will then be gilt. Hold the clapper up to the bell by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
string, so that half of the clapper is below the bottom edge of
the bell; then, bringing the string close to the point at the top
of the bell, run a pin through the string to mark the distance.
Where the pin is, tie a knot, F (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>); this is to hold the
clapper in its proper position. Thread the end of the string
through the eye of a darning-needle and push the needle up
through the point of the bell&mdash;the knot will keep the string
from running up too far (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>). Allow eight or ten inches
of string above the bell, so that it may be hung high or low, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
desired. A bell should never be tied close to a branch, but
should hang down far enough to sway with every passing
current of air. The long string also adds to the decorative
effect.</p>

<p>Cut a strip of white tissue-paper five and a half inches
wide and twenty-two inches long. Fold the paper crosswise
through the middle; then fold it again and again until your
folded piece is one inch wide. The folds must always be
across the paper from start to finish (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>). Now, cut
slits in the folded paper, first a slit on one side, and then a slit
on the other, as in <a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>. Let the spaces between the
slits be one-eighth of an inch wide, and cut each slit to within
one-eighth of an inch of the edge. When this is done, carefully
unfold the paper and spread it out flat, then lift the top
edge with one hand, the bottom edge with the other, and
gently pull the meshes apart. Gather the top edge into little
plaits, and twist them together in a point; gather the bottom
edge in the same way and twist that; then carefully pull the
snow pocket out, and you will have a long, narrow bag of
soft, white meshes. If it flares out too much, crush it together
softly with your hand. Make a small gilt paper star
and fasten a narrow strip of white tissue-paper to its top point.
Open the bag, slip the star inside, and suspend it half-way
from the top by pasting the end of the paper strip to the top
of the bag. Make a loop of tissue-paper, fasten it to the top
point of the bag, and then hang the snow pocket on the tree.
The gold star gleaming through the frosty meshes is very
pretty, but if you have several snow pockets, there need not
be stars in all.</p>


<h3>Jocko, the Monkey</h3>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a>) is not made of paper, but of delectable, sugary

suitably shaped one for the head. There must be three raisins
for each leg, one for each foot, and three for each arm.
Tie a knot in the end of your string and, beginning with one
foot, string on three raisins for one leg, then the three for
the body, and, lastly, the one for the head. Tie a knot close
to the top at the head and leave a long end to the string.
Thread your needle again and string on the raisins for the

<p>String three raisins for one arm, run the needle through
the middle of the top body raisin, where the shoulders should
be, then string on the three raisins for the other arm and tie
a knot at the end. Jocko is all right now, except that he is
very limp. Put stiffening into his joints by running broom
straws through his legs, body, and arms. Use a raisin stem
for the tail, and fasten it on by pushing the largest end into
the lowest body raisin. Make the eyes by running a short
piece of broom straw through the head, allowing the ends
to stand out a short distance in the place for the eyes. Remember
a monkey's eyes are always close together, and they
must be made so in order to look natural.</p>

<p>At this stage Jocko will resemble <a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>; but he must have
clothes and a hat to give the finishing touches and make him
look like the monkeys the children are familiar with. <a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a>
is Jocko's hat, <a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a> his coat, and <a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a> his little skirt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut all of these from bright-colored cambric of a size to fit
the monkey. Fold a piece of cambric for the coat, and cut it
out as you would for a paper doll, with the fold at the top.
The skirt and hat are circular. Cut a round hole in the
middle of the skirt for the waist, and slit it down the back.
This furnishes the costume.</p>

good to eat.</p>


<h3>The Chrysanthemum</h3>

<div class='unindent'>ornament is showy and pretty; it is also very quickly made.
Fold through the middle a piece of bright orange tissue-paper
six inches square. This will give you an oblong.
Fold again through the middle crosswise, and you will have
a smaller square. Bring the two opposite corners of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
square together and fold like <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>; then cut off the point
curving the edge, as shown by the dotted line. The folded
part of the triangle is at the diagonal in <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>, the edges
at the bottom. Now cut slits in your triangle like <a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>.
Open it, and you will have <a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>. Make two fringed
circles like <a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>, lay one on top of the other, pinch the
centre in a point, twist it, and draw the fringed ends together

the point of the ornament with paste, insert it in the large
end of the lighter, and press together with your fingers until
it holds tight. The result will be like <a href="#Fig_208">Fig. 208</a>. In fastening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

<div class='unindent'>looped from branch to branch, take the place of colored glass
balls, and add materially to the beauty of the tree.</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a> shows how these strings are made. Red, gold,
yellow, orange, green, blue, and white make pretty disks, and
show off well on the tree.</p>


<p>Cut your disks perfectly round, and in pairs; for they must
be the same on both sides, G, H (<a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>). You can make
the disks on some strings
all of one size; on others
they may graduate down
to quite small ones at the
ends. When the disks are
cut out, lay one down,
bottom side up, H (<a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>). Cover this with
paste, then lay a white
cotton string across the
disk, directly through the
middle. Allow about six
inches of the string to extend
beyond the disk, and
let each string be one yard
long. Before the paste
has time to dry, press the
mate of the disk, G (<a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>), on top of H, over
the string, taking care to have the edges even. Go through
this process with each disk. Paste them on the string one
inch apart, and leave six inches of string at the last end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>Fringed Ornament</h3>

<div class='unindent'>made of colored and gilt paper. The foundation is a round
disk of white writing-paper, two inches in diameter. To this
is pasted the ends of a narrow light-blue ribbon, long enough
to form a loop by which to hang the ornament. For the rest,
cut two circles of light-pink tissue-paper, six inches in diameter,
fringe them on the edges to the depth of one inch,
making the fringe quite fine; then paste one circle on one
side of the foundation, the other circle on the other side.
Now, from your gold paper cut six long, narrow triangles,
and cut the wide end into fringe two inches deep (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Paste these tufts of gold fringe at equal distances on the
pink circle, making the points meet at the centre. Make a
smaller, light-blue, fringed circle, and a still smaller pink
circle. Paste the centre of the blue circle over the centre
of the gold fringe, and the centre of the small pink circle
over the centre of the blue. Cut out a small, eight-pointed
gold star and paste directly in the middle of the pink circle.
You can vary this kind of ornament in a number of ways.

<div class='unindent'>and, whether lighted or not, they are always prominently in
evidence. Of late years the people have grown wise in the
matter of fires, and many parents refuse to light the Christmas
candles on their children's tree because of the great danger of
conflagration.</div>


<p><a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a> shows some paper candles on an evergreen branch,
standing upright and burning briskly. The candles may be
made of white as well as colored paper. Make an oblong, K
(<a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>), four inches long and two and a half inches wide,
the wick one-quarter of an inch high, and the back of the
flame, L, three-quarters of an inch long. From orange-colored
tissue-paper cut the flame (<a href="#Fig_215">Fig. 215</a>). This should
be a little over a half an inch wide at the base and two inches
long. Lay an oblong on the table in front of you; take a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
large-sized pencil; place it on the long edge farthest away
from the flame, and roll it on the pencil (<a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a>) until the
opposite edge overlaps the roll. Then run the paste brush
along the edge and paste it down. Your candle is now a
hollow roll. Slip the roll off the pencil and cut two slim
notches opposite to each other, in the bottom edge (<a href="#Fig_217">Fig. 217</a>).
Make the notches on some of the candles at the front and
back, on others at each side. This is so that the flames may
always face outward, though the branches that hold the
candles may turn in various directions. Lastly, paste the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
flame on the back of the flame, allowing the tip to flare out at
one side as though stirred by a current of air (<a href="#Fig_217">Fig. 217</a>).</p>

<p>In placing the candles, stand them up astride the branches
by means of the notches at the bottom, turning the right side
of the flame always toward the room. The tiniest twigs will
hold these paper candles easily, and when the needles of the
fir interfere with their adjustment, pull off some of the needles
and set the candles astride the bare places on the branches.</p>

<p>Finish the tree by throwing over it a web of long, very
narrow strips of white and orange-colored tissue-paper.</p>

<p>The narrower the strips the better they will look.</p>

<p>It hardly seems necessary to offer a word of caution, but it
will do no harm to say that the flame of gas, candle, or fire,
should not come near this paper-decked tree, though it is
scarcely more inflammable than a tree trimmed with tinsel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A HOME-MADE SANTA CLAUS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Merry Christmas</span>! Merry Christmas!" calls out Santa
Claus cheerily as the guests come trooping into the room.</p>

<p>Laughing and joking, his eyes twinkling with fun, Santa
Claus names each person as he hands out the gifts from his
fat Christmas bag and from the generous pile at his feet. All
this merriment happens at Christmastide when you play the
part of good "Kris Kringle" in your own home, in the schoolroom,
the Sunday-school, or in any place where Christmas is
celebrated and where children are gathered to enjoy the
festivities.</p>

<p>Take a good long look at Santa Claus, as shown in the
picture (<a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>); then turn your eyes to the illustration (<a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>). Can you believe it possible that the two photographs
are of the same person in identically the same pose? Such
is truly the case. The second gives the woman's back, while
the first shows her face, arms, and hands transformed into
those of the jolly saint.</p>

<p>You can see at a glance how very easy it will be for you to
have a real, live, little Santa Claus for your Christmas.</p>

<p>Any one&mdash;grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, big
sister or brother, or you yourself&mdash;can assume the character
of this live little saint, can grow suddenly short of stature,
jolly and fat, be arrayed in scarlet, ermine-trimmed, and
crowned with a red-peaked hat, all in less time than it takes
to tell it; and, stranger still, the transformation may be
accomplished in a very comfortable way, without even the
bother of changing the usual attire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>It is essential merely to paste on the face tufts of raw cotton
for eyebrows, mustache and goatee, and to slip over each
arm an extra sleeve. This accomplished, and the proper
position taken behind the curtain, lo, "magic change"!
There you are as fine a little Santa Claus as any one would
care to see, and your best friend would not recognize you, so
complete is the change. Disguise your voice and no one can
find you out, not even your nearest relative.</p>


<div class='center'>

<p>When the gifts have been distributed and you are ready
to go out among the excited children or family circle again,
step from the curtain, pull off the extra sleeves, remove the
cotton from your face, and in a moment's time you will again
be your own natural self.</p>

<p>When preparing this entertainment you will find the demand
on your purse very slight, the principal outlay being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for the curtain. Purchase moss-green lining cambric, at
four, five, or six cents a yard, to stretch over the doorway you
intend to use. Two yards and a quarter cut in one full
breadth and one half breadth, when sewed together into a
curtain, will be enough for an ordinary doorway. Doorways
vary in size, however, and it is best to take the measurements
of yours before buying the material. The space between
the folding doors will probably call for five yards of cambric.
When the strips of cloth are sewed together, stretch the
curtain taut over the opening, tacking it at long intervals on
the topmost level of the wood-work over the door and on the
extreme edge of the door jamb next to the wall. If fastened
in this manner, tacks will not injure the wood-work.</p>

<p>Stand on the floor facing the centre of the curtain and mark
the place where your face comes; then where your arms will
most easily pass through the curtain. Cut holes in the cloth,
one for your face with chin entirely through, and two for
your arms (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>). Cut the holes small; they can be
enlarged if necessary.</p>

<p>Make Santa Claus's cap of a piece of scarlet cambric
twelve inches wide and seventeen inches long; tie one end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with a string into a tassel; then pin the cap on top of the
face opening (<a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>), and cut the lower edge into a curve
to fit the hole as indicated by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>.
One width of scarlet cambric twenty-six inches long, used
just as it comes, will make the jacket.</p>

<p>Draw in one edge of the coat to meet the inner edge of the
armhole and pin it there; do the same with the other side,
and you will have fulness in front to allow for padding.
Bring the sides around the armhole outward again and pin
in place; then fold up a wide hem and pin the sides of the
jacket to the curtain and fill out the inside of the jacket with
half sheets of newspaper lightly crumpled (<a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>).</p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 224&mdash;Santa Claus&#39;s costume ready for the impersonator.</span>
</div>
<p>Pin enough paper to the curtain under the coat to give
the body of Santa Claus a decidedly rounded appearance; be
sure that the padding is securely fastened to the curtain.
Then pin the sleeve caps, cut according to <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>, around
the outer edge of the armhole. Pin raw white cotton around
the face opening to form the hair and long, full beard. Allow
the cotton to come well over the edge of the hole, that it may
lie naturally on Santa Claus's face.</p>

<p>With ink, mark the fleecy side of the strips of white canton
flannel to resemble white ermine. Notice particularly the
shape of the black ermine dots and have yours like them.
Pin one ermine strip down the front of the red jacket and
another across the bottom edge. Make two long, separate
scarlet sleeves, unhemmed at top and bottom, and pin a band
of ermine around each for a cuff. The only necessary sewing
for the entire costume is the seams of the sleeves.</p>


<p>Polish up a pair of ordinary old shoes, stuff them out with
newspapers, and use them for Santa Claus's feet. Roll two
pieces of cardboard, or pieces of limber pasteboard boxes, into
cylinders; ink or blacken them. When dry, cut a curve in one
end of each, like <a href="#Fig_223">Fig. 223</a>, and fit these tops over the stuffed
shoes to make them into boots. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Set the boots on a bench or
a low table, placed across in front of Santa Claus, and adjust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
them under the coat, so the little fellow will appear to be
standing on the bench (<a href="#Fig_224">Fig. 224</a>). Pin Christmas greens,
either natural or of tissue-paper, over the top and down the
sides of the curtain, and you will have a unique, very effective,
and novel arrangement for Christmas, easy to make, and
costing but a trifle. Try it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>NATURE STUDY WITH TISSUE-PAPER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A natural</span> flower, some tissue-paper, a pair of scissors, a
spool of thread, and nimble fingers are all you need.</p>

<p>There are no patterns, only circles and squares and strips
of paper which you gather here, spread out there, wrap
and tie somewhere else, and, with deft fingers, model into
almost exact reproductions of the natural flower before
you.</p>

<p>With its unfamiliar terms to be committed to memory and
the many parts of the flower to be distinguished, botany is
apt to prove dry and tiresome to the little child, but to study
nature by copying the flowers in this marvellously adaptable
material is only a beautiful game which every child, and
indeed many grown people, will delight in. The form of the
flower, its name and color, may, by this means, be indelibly
stamped upon the memory, and a good foundation laid for
further study.</p>


<h3>The Best Models</h3>

<p>Ordinary garden flowers and those most easily procured
make the best models. The carnation, the morning-glory,
and the rarer blossoms of the hibiscus are well adapted
to the work, also the daffodil and some of the wonderful
orchids.</p>

<p>Even holly, with its sharp-spiked leaves and scarlet berries,
and the white-berried, pale green mistletoe may be closely
copied. All these and many more are made on the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
principle, and in so simple a manner that even quite a little
child may succeed in producing very good copies from nature.</p>


<h3>Material</h3>

<p>Buy a sheet of light pink tissue-paper, another of darker
pink, and one of the darkest red you can find; then a sheet
of light yellow-green and one of dark green. Have a table
"cleared for the action" and place your paper on the right-hand
side, adding a
pair of scissors and a
spool of coarse thread,
or, better still, of soft
darning cotton.</p>

<p>With all this you
are to copy the</p>


<h3>Carnation</h3>

<div class='unindent'>which some one has
given you or you
have growing in your
own garden. Make
one of your light pink
paper, one of the
darker pink, and another
of the rich, deep
red to have a variety

<p>Lay your natural
flower down on the
left-hand side of the table, away from your material, but
within quite easy reach, for it must be consulted frequently.
Seat yourself comfortably and don't work hurriedly.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary in this system of squares and
circles is to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Cut a Circle Quickly</h3>

</div></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Cut a square the size you wish to make your circle.
That is, if you want a
circle with a diameter of
four inches, cut a four-inch
square (<a href="#Fig_226">Fig. 226</a>).
Fold the square diagonally
through the centre
according to the dotted
line on <a href="#Fig_226">Fig. 226</a>, and you
have a triangle (<a href="#Fig_227">Fig. 227</a>).
Fold this at the dotted
line and it will make another
triangle (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>).
Again fold through the
middle and you have
the third triangle (<a href="#Fig_229">Fig. 229</a>). Fold once more and <a href="#Fig_230">Fig. 230</a> is the result. Measure
the distance from the
edge, B, to the centre,
A, in <a href="#Fig_230">Fig. 230</a>, and mark
the same distance on the
other side of the triangle
shown by the dot, C (<a href="#Fig_231">Fig. 231</a>). With your scissors
cut across from C to B,
curving the edge slightly,
as shown by the dotted
line from C to B (<a href="#Fig_231">Fig. 231</a>). <a href="#Fig_232">Fig. 232</a> is the

<p>Your eye will soon become sufficiently accurate to enable
you to gauge the distance from A to B, and you can then cut
from C to B without measuring.</p>


<h3>Before Beginning Your Flower</h3>

<div class='unindent'>take up the natural one and examine it carefully. You will
notice that it has a great many petals crowded closely together,
and that their edges are pointed like a saw. You will also
see that the calyx is wrapped snugly around the lower part
of the flower, and that it, too, has a pointed edge.</div>

<p>Now hold the pink off at arm's length. The separateness
of the petals disappears and you see them only as a mass;
the points on the edges are not noticeable except as they give
the flower a crimped appearance, and the edge of the calyx
looks almost straight. It is this appearance or the impression
of the flower that you are to produce rather than its many
and little separate parts. So now set to work.</p>


<h3>Cut Two Squares for Each Pink</h3>

<div class='unindent'>one measuring five and a quarter inches, the other four and
three-quarters inches, and turn them into circles (<a href="#Fig_233">Fig. 233</a>),
by the method just explained. Take one of the circles at the
centre, where the folding lines cross, with the tips of the fingers
of your left hand, and pinch it together; then, while still
holding it, crimp the edge with the fingers of your right hand
(<a href="#Fig_234">Fig. 234</a>). Do this always with every kind of flower, whether
it be made of circles or squares. Without loosening your
hold of the centre, draw the paper lightly through your right
hand several times, then crimp the edge again, this time with
the blade of the scissors. Treat all the circles alike, then
place a small circle inside a larger one and draw them through
your hand to bring them close together, pinching them closely
until within a little over an inch of the edge (<a href="#Fig_235">Fig. 235</a>). Make
a slender lighter of ordinary writing-paper (<a href="#Fig_236">Fig. 236</a>), snip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
off the point of the flower, D, in <a href="#Fig_235">Fig. 235</a>, open the other end
a little, and push the lighter through until its head is hidden.
This forms the stem. Wrap and tie with thread at the
bottom of the flower (<a href="#Fig_237">Fig. 237</a>), and again where the petals
spread. This last is to be but temporary, as you will remove
the thread when the flower is sufficiently pressed together to
hold its shape.</div>

to make the half circle for the calyx (<a href="#Fig_238">Fig. 238</a>). Remove the
thread that holds the flower just below its petals and wrap the
calyx closely around the lower part, tying it at the bottom;
then cut a narrow strip of dark green paper and wrap it
spirally around the stem, beginning at the top (<a href="#Fig_239">Fig. 239</a>).
Let the wrapper extend a little below the lighter and twist
the end to hold it in place. Spread the petals of your flower
as much like the natural blossom as possible.</p>

<p>For the leaves cut a strip of dark green paper six inches

shown by the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_240">Fig. 240</a>. Gather it along this
line, not with needle and thread&mdash;we use no needle in this
work&mdash;but with your fingers, and pinch it together; then twist
each end into a point (<a href="#Fig_241">Fig. 241</a>). With the sharp end of your
scissors punch a hole directly through the centre, E (<a href="#Fig_241">Fig. 241</a>), and push the point of the stem through the hole, bringing
the leaves as far up on the stem as you find them on the
natural flower; then wrap and tie them in place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>



<h3>The Bud</h3>

edge with the scissors. It will then form a little bag or cup
like <a href="#Fig_242">Fig. 242</a>. Slip the bag over the head of the lighter and
tie at the bottom, as in <a href="#Fig_243">Fig. 243</a>. If the bud does not take
the proper shape at first, model it with your fingers until it is
correct. Start the wrapping of the stem just above where the
bud is tied and finish as you did the stem of the pink. Use
small leaves on the bud stem, having the strip of paper just as
wide, but considerably shorter than for the leaves on the stem
of the open flower.</div>

<p>It is wonderful how very natural these blossoms appear. At
a short distance no one would think they are not the real, old
and familiar pinks. Only the fragrance is missing, and that
may also be supplied and a spicy odor given by inclosing a
whole clove in the heart of each flower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>



<h3>The Morning-Glory</h3>

</div>

<p>From the pale pink paper you can make a delicately beautiful
morning-glory (<a href="#Fig_244">Fig. 244</a>). Have the natural flower with
its stem and leaves to copy from, even if the blossom is not
the color you want. As with the pink, it is the general form
and appearance we strive for in the morning-glory, not the
detail.</p>

<p>Make your pink circles with a diameter of about seven
inches. It is always better to have your flowers a trifle
larger than the natural ones, rather than smaller.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 294px;"><a name="Fig_245" id="Fig_245"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Fig.</span> 245&mdash;Flatten out the top.</span>
</div>

<p>But one circle is required for each morning-glory. Crimp
this in your fingers and draw through your hand as you did the
circles for the pinks; then, pinching it together to within one
and a half inches of the edge, hold it in your left hand and
flatten out the top, as in <a href="#Fig_245">Fig. 245</a>. See that the fulness is
evenly distributed, and pull and straighten out the edges until
you are satisfied with its appearance.</p>

<p>A piece of bonnet-wire makes the best stem if you wish to
give the true viny effect of the growth. If it is only the
blossom you are making, a paper lighter will answer. When
you use the wire, bend one end over to form a small loop;
this is to keep the stem from slipping through the flower.
Pass the straight end of the wire through the centre of the
flower and draw it down until the loop is hidden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

the stem. Wind the stem with light green tissue-paper and
bend it as the natural one is bent and curved.</div>

<p>The wilted flower shown in the illustration is made by
taking one of the morning-glories you have just finished
and actually wilting it by drawing the flower together and
creasing and pressing it to resemble the partially closed and
drooping natural blossom.</p>

<p>Only a piece of dark green paper six inches square is
required to model two almost perfectly shaped morning-glory
leaves.</p>

<p>Fold the square twice diagonally across from corner to
corner to find its centre; then begin at one corner and gather
along one of the creases until you reach the centre (<a href="#Fig_251">Fig. 251</a>).
Start again at the opposite corner, gather along the crease to
the centre, then wrap and tie (<a href="#Fig_252">Fig. 252</a>). Pinch each leaf from
underneath along the crease in the middle, to give the depression
at the midrib. Straighten the leaf out a little at its
widest part and you will find you have a pair of leaves which
are surprisingly natural. Wrap and tie these to the stem
and make as many more as you think are needed.</p>
